When you [install OpenRAG](/install-options), you provide the initial configuration values for your OpenRAG services, including authentication credentials for OpenSearch and optional OAuth connectors.

:::warning
Google is the only supported OAuth provider for OpenRAG.

Other [OAuth credentials](/reference/configuration#oauth-and-cloud-storage-connector-settings) are used only to authorize [cloud storage connectors](/knowledge-connectors).
:::

The presence of Google OAuth credentials determines how OpenRAG authenticates with your deployment's OpenSearch knowledge base, and how it controls user access to documents in your knowledge base:

* **No-auth mode**: If you don't provide Google OAuth credentials, then the OpenRAG OpenSearch knowledge base runs in no-auth mode. This mode uses one anonymous JWT token for OpenSearch authentication. There is no differentiation between users; all users that access your OpenRAG instance can access all documents uploaded to your knowledge base.

* **OAuth mode**: If you provide Google OAuth credentials, then the OpenRAG OpenSearch knowledge base runs in OAuth mode. This mode uses a unique JWT token for each OpenRAG user, and each document is tagged with user ownership. Documents are filtered by user owner; users see only the documents that they uploaded or have access to through their cloud storage accounts.

:::tip
To enable OAuth mode, you must [configure the Google Drive cloud storage connector for document ingestion](/knowledge-connectors).
This is because OpenRAG uses Google OAuth credentials for both OAuth mode _and_ the Google Drive cloud storage connector.

You can enable OAuth mode after initial setup by configuring the Google Drive connector.
