1. If you modified the built-in flows or created custom flows in your [OpenRAG Langflow instance](/agents), [export your flows](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-flows-import) before starting this process. Although OpenRAG can preserve changes to the built-in flows, it doesn't preserve user-created flows. As a general best practice, exporting your flows is recommended to create backups of your customizations. Afterwards, you can reimport your flows or reference the exported flow JSON as needed.
