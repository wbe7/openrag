This page provides troubleshooting advice for issues you might encounter when using OpenRAG or contributing to OpenRAG.

## OpenSearch fails to start

Check that the value of the `OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD` [environment variable](/reference/configuration) meets the [OpenSearch password complexity requirements](https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/security/configuration/demo-configuration/#setting-up-a-custom-admin-password).

If you need to change the password, you must [reset the OpenRAG services](/manage-services).

## OpenRAG fails to start from the TUI with operation not supported

This error occurs when starting OpenRAG with the TUI in [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

The error occurs because OpenRAG is running within a WSL environment, so `webbrowser.open()` can't launch a browser automatically.

To access the OpenRAG application, open a web browser and enter `http://localhost:3000` in the address bar.

## OpenRAG installation fails with unable to get local issuer certificate

If you are installing OpenRAG on macOS, and the installation fails with `unable to get local issuer certificate`, run the following command, and then retry the installation:

```bash
open "/Applications/Python VERSION/Install Certificates.command"
```

Replace `VERSION` with your installed Python version, such as `3.13`.

## Langflow connection issues

Verify that the value of the `LANGFLOW_SUPERUSER` environment variable is correct.
For more information about this variable and how this variable controls Langflow access, see [Langflow settings](/reference/configuration#langflow-settings).

## Container out of memory errors

Increase Docker memory allocation or use the CPU-only deployment (base `docker-compose.yml` without GPU override) to reduce memory usage.

## Memory issue with Podman on macOS

If you're using Podman on macOS, you might need to increase VM memory on your Podman machine.
This example increases the machine size to 8 GB of RAM, which should be sufficient to run OpenRAG.

```bash
podman machine stop
podman machine rm
podman machine init --memory 8192   # 8 GB example
podman machine start
```

## Port conflicts

With the default [environment variable](/reference/configuration) values, OpenRAG requires the following ports to be available on the host machine:

* 3000: Langflow application
* 5001: Docling local ingestion service
* 5601: OpenSearch Dashboards
* 7860: Docling UI
* 8000: Docling API
* 9200: OpenSearch service

## OCR ingestion fails (easyocr not installed)

Docling ingestion can fail with an OCR-related error that mentions `easyocr` is missing.
This is likely due to a stale `uv` cache when you [install OpenRAG with `uvx`](/install-uvx).

When you invoke OpenRAG with `uvx openrag`, `uvx` creates a cached, ephemeral environment that doesn't modify your project.
The location and path of this cache depends on your operating system.
For example, on macOS, this is typically a user cache directory, such as `~/.cache/uv`.

This cache can become stale, producing errors like missing dependencies.

1. If the TUI is open, press <kbd>q</kbd> to exit the TUI.

2. Clear the `uv` cache:

   ```bash
   uv cache clean
   ```

   To clear the OpenRAG cache only, run:

   ```bash
   uv cache clean openrag
   ```

3. Invoke OpenRAG to restart the TUI:

   ```bash
   uvx openrag
   ```

4. Click **Launch OpenRAG**, and then retry document ingestion.

If you install OpenRAG with `uv`, dependencies are synced directly from your `pyproject.toml` file.
This should automatically install `easyocr` because `easyocr` is included as a dependency in OpenRAG's `pyproject.toml`.

If you don't need OCR, you can disable OCR-based processing in your [ingestion settings](/knowledge#knowledge-ingestion-settings) to avoid requiring `easyocr`.

## Upgrade fails due to Langflow container already exists {#langflow-container-already-exists-during-upgrade}

If you encounter a `langflow container already exists` error when upgrading OpenRAG, this typically means you upgraded OpenRAG with `uv`, but you didn't remove or upgrade containers from a previous installation.

To resolve this issue, do the following:

1. Remove only the Langflow container:

   1. Stop the Langflow container:

      ```bash title="Docker"
      docker stop langflow
      ```

      ```bash title="Podman"
      podman stop langflow
      ```

   2. Remove the Langflow container:

      ```bash title="Docker"
      docker rm langflow --force
      ```

      ```bash title="Podman"
      podman rm langflow --force
      ```

2. Retry the [upgrade](/upgrade).

3. If reinstalling the Langflow container doesn't resolve the issue, then you must [reset all containers](/manage-services) or [reinstall OpenRAG](/reinstall).

4. Retry the [upgrade](/upgrade).

   If no updates are available after reinstalling OpenRAG, then you reinstalled at the latest version, and your deployment is up to date.
