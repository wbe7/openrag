GPU acceleration isn't required for most use cases.
OpenRAG's CPU-only deployment doesn't prevent you from using GPU acceleration in external services, such as Ollama servers.

GPU acceleration is required only for specific use cases, typically involving customization of the ingestion flows or ingestion logic.
For example, writing alternate ingest logic in OpenRAG that uses GPUs directly in the container, or customizing the ingestion flows to use Langflow's Docling component with GPU acceleration instead of OpenRAG's Docling Serve service.
