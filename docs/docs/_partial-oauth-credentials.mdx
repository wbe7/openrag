* **Google**: Enter your **Google OAuth Client ID** and **Google OAuth Client Secret**. You can generate these in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials). For more information, see the [Google OAuth client documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2).

   Providing these Google credentials enables OAuth mode _and_ the Google Drive cloud storage connector.

   :::warning
   Google is the only supported OAuth provider for OpenRAG.

   You must enter Google credentials if you want to enable OAuth mode.

   The Microsoft and Amazon credentials are used only to authorize the cloud storage connectors.
   OpenRAG doesn't offer OAuth provider integrations for Microsoft or Amazon.
