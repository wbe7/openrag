1. In the TUI, click either **Basic Setup** or **Advanced Setup**.

   :::info
   You must use **Advanced Setup** if you want to enable either [OAuth mode or cloud storage connectors](/knowledge-connectors) during initial set up:

   * **OAuth mode**: Controls document ownership and access in your OpenRAG [OpenSearch knowledge base](/knowledge).
   Without OAuth mode, there is no differentiation between users; all users that access your OpenRAG instance can access and manage all uploaded documents.
   * **Cloud storage connectors**: Enables ingestion of documents from external storage services.
   :::

   If OpenRAG detects [OAuth or cloud storage connector credentials](/reference/configuration#oauth-and-cloud-storage-connector-settings) during setup, it recommends **Advanced Setup** in the TUI.

   You can also enable these features later.

2. Enter administrator passwords for the OpenRAG OpenSearch and Langflow services.

   The OpenSearch password is required, and a secure password is automatically generated if you don't provide one manually.

   The Langflow password is recommended but optional.
   If the Langflow password is empty, the Langflow server starts without authentication enabled. For more information, see [Langflow settings](/reference/configuration#langflow-settings).

   You can click **Generate Password** to create a Langflow password and username automatically.

3. Optional: Under **API Keys**, enter your model provider credentials, or leave these fields empty if you want to configure model provider credentials during the application onboarding process.

   There is no material difference between providing these values now or during the [application onboarding process](#application-onboarding).
   If you provide a credential now, it can be populated automatically during the application onboarding process if you enable the **Use environment API key** option.

   OpenRAG's core functionality requires access to language and embedding models.
   By default, OpenRAG uses OpenAI models.
   If you aren't sure which models or providers to use, you must provide an OpenAI API key to use OpenRAG's default model configuration.

4. **Advanced Setup** only: To enable OAuth mode or cloud storage connectors, do the following:

   1. Register OpenRAG as an OAuth application in your cloud provider, and then obtain the app's OAuth credentials, such as a client ID and secret key. To enable multiple connectors, you must register an app and generate credentials for each provider.

   2. Enter the relevant OAuth credentials under **API Keys** in the TUI's **Advanced Setup**:

      <PartialOAuthCredentials />

      The credentials can be populated automatically if OpenRAG detects these credentials in an [OpenRAG `.env` file](/reference/configuration) at `~/.openrag/tui`.

   3. Register the redirect URIs shown in the TUI in your OAuth apps.

      The redirect URIs are used for the cloud storage connector webhooks. For Google, the redirect URIs are also used to redirect users back to OpenRAG after they sign in.

5. Optional: Under **Langfuse (Tracing)**, enter Langfuse credentials to enable the [Langflow integration with Langfuse](https://docs.langflow.org/integrations-langfuse):

   * **Langfuse Secret Key**: A secret key for your Langfuse project.
   * **Langfuse Public Key**: A public key for your Langfuse project.
   * **Langfuse Host**: Required for self-hosted Langfuse deployments. Leave empty for Langfuse Cloud.

6. Optional: Under **Others**, you can edit the following settings if needed:

   * **Documents Paths**: Set the [local documents path](/ingestion-configure#set-the-local-documents-path). Use the default path, or provide a path to a directory where you want OpenRAG to look for documents to ingest into your [knowledge base](/knowledge).
   * **OpenSearch Data Path**: Use the default path, or specify the path where you want OpenRAG to create your OpenSearch index.
   * **Langflow Public URL (Advanced Setup only)** : Sets the base address to access the Langflow web interface where users interact with the Langflow editor in a browser. You must set this value to run Langflow on a non-default port (`7860`)
   * **Webhook Base URL (Advanced Setup only)**: If you entered OAuth credentials, you can set the base address for your OAuth connector endpoints. If set, the OAuth connector webhook URLs are constructed as `WEBHOOK_BASE_URL/connectors/${provider}/webhook`. This option is required to enable automatic ingestion from cloud storage.

7. Click **Save Configuration**.

   Your passwords, API key, and OAuth credentials (if provided) are stored in the [OpenRAG `.env` file](/reference/configuration) at `~/.openrag/tui`.
   If you modified any credentials that were pulled from an existing `.env` file, those values are updated in the `.env` file.

8. Click **Start OpenRAG** to start the OpenRAG services.

   This process can take some time while OpenRAG pulls and runs the container images.
   If all services start successfully, the TUI prints a confirmation message:

   ```text
   Services started successfully
   Command completed successfully
   ```

9. Click **Close**, and then click **Launch OpenRAG** or navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

   If you provided Google OAuth credentials, you must sign in with Google before you are redirected to your OpenRAG instance.

10. Continue with the [application onboarding process](#application-onboarding).
