1. [Install WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) with the Ubuntu distribution using WSL 2:

   ```powershell
   wsl --install -d Ubuntu
   ```

   For new installations, the `wsl --install` command uses WSL 2 and Ubuntu by default.

   For existing WSL installations, you can [change the distribution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#change-the-default-linux-distribution-installed) and [check the WSL version](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#upgrade-version-from-wsl-1-to-wsl-2).

   :::warning Known limitation
   OpenRAG isn't compatible with nested virtualization, which can cause networking issues.
   Don't install OpenRAG on a WSL distribution that is installed inside a Windows VM.
   Instead, install OpenRAG on your base OS or a non-nested Linux VM.

2. [Start your WSL Ubuntu distribution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#ways-to-run-multiple-linux-distributions-with-wsl) if it doesn't start automatically.

3. [Set up a username and password for your WSL distribution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment#set-up-your-linux-username-and-password).

4. [Install Docker Desktop for Windows with WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-containers). When you reach the Docker Desktop **WSL integration** settings, make sure your Ubuntu distribution is enabled, and then click **Apply & Restart** to enable Docker support in WSL.

5. Install and run OpenRAG from within your WSL Ubuntu distribution.

If you encounter issues with port forwarding or the Windows Firewall, you might need to adjust the [Hyper-V firewall settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/network-security/windows-firewall/hyper-v-firewall) to allow communication between your WSL distribution and the Windows host. For more troubleshooting advice for networking issues, see [Troubleshooting WSL common issues](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/troubleshooting#common-issues).
