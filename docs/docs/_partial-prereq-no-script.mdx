* Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

* Install [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation) or [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

   The OpenRAG team recommends, at minimum, 8 GB of RAM for container VMs.
   However, if you plan to upload large files regularly, more RAM is recommended.
   For more information, see [Troubleshoot OpenRAG](/support/troubleshoot).

* Install [`podman-compose`](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-compose.1.html) or [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
To use Docker Compose with Podman, you must alias Docker Compose commands to Podman commands.
