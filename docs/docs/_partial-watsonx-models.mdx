OpenRAG isn't guaranteed to be compatible with all models that are available through IBM watsonx.ai.

Language models must support tool calling to be compatible with OpenRAG.
Incompatible models aren't listed in OpenRAG's settings or onboarding.

Additionally, models must be able to handle the agentic reasoning tasks required by OpenRAG.
Models that are too small or not designed for agentic RAG tasks can return low quality, incorrect, or improperly formatted responses.
For more information, see [Troubleshoot chat](/chat#troubleshoot-chat).

You can submit an [OpenRAG GitHub issue](https://github.com/langflow-ai/openrag/issues) to request support for specific models.
