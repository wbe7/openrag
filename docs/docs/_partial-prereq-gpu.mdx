* Optional: Install GPU support with an NVIDIA GPU, [CUDA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/) support, and compatible NVIDIA drivers on the OpenRAG host machine.
If you don't have GPU capabilities, OpenRAG provides an alternate CPU-only deployment that is suitable for most use cases.
The default CPU-only deployment doesn't prevent you from using GPU acceleration in external services, such as Ollama servers.
