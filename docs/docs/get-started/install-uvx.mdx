title: Invoke OpenRAG with uvx
slug: /install-uvx
---

For guided configuration and simplified container management, install OpenRAG with containers managed by the [Terminal User Interface (TUI)](/tui).

You can use [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uvx/getting-started/installation/) to invoke OpenRAG without permanently installing it in a Python project.
`uvx` installs OpenRAG in an ephemeral, isolated virtual environment.

This method is best when you want to test OpenRAG outside of a Python project or you don't need to preserve the OpenRAG installation.
Depending on your project structure, `uvx` might not be suitable for production deployments.

:::tip
The [automatic installer script](/install) also uses `uvx` to install OpenRAG.

For other installation methods, see [Choose an installation method](/install-options).
