title: Invoke OpenRAG with uvx
slug: /install-uvx
---

For guided configuration and simplified container management, install OpenRAG with containers managed by the [Terminal User Interface (TUI)](/tui).

You can use [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uvx/getting-started/installation/) to invoke OpenRAG without permanently installing it in a Python project.
`uvx` installs OpenRAG in an ephemeral, isolated virtual environment.

This method is best when you want to test OpenRAG outside of a Python project or you don't need to preserve the OpenRAG installation.
Depending on your project structure, `uvx` might not be suitable for production deployments.

:::tip
The [automatic installer script](/install) also uses `uvx` to install OpenRAG.

For other installation methods, see [Choose an installation method](/install-options).

## Install and run OpenRAG with uvx

    Use `uvx` to quickly run OpenRAG without creating a project or modifying any files.

    1. Create a directory to store the OpenRAG configuration files:
       ```bash
       mkdir openrag-workspace
       cd openrag-workspace
       ```

    2. Run OpenRAG:
       ```bash
       uvx openrag
       ```

       To run a specific version:
       ```bash
       uvx --from openrag==0.1.30 openrag
       ```
<!-- move down to the setup section?? -->
    When you install OpenRAG with `uvx`, OpenRAG creates its `.env` and `docker-compose.yml` files in the current working directory.

    If you encounter errors during installation, see [Troubleshoot OpenRAG](/support/troubleshoot).

## Set up OpenRAG with the TUI

When the Terminal User Interface (TUI) starts, you must complete the initial setup to configure OpenRAG.
