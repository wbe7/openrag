[Install OpenRAG](#install) and then run the [OpenRAG Terminal User Interface(TUI)](#setup) to start your OpenRAG deployment with a guided setup process.

The OpenRAG Terminal User Interface (TUI) allows you to set up, configure, and monitor your OpenRAG deployment directly from the terminal.

![OpenRAG TUI Interface](@site/static/img/OpenRAG_TUI_2025-09-10T13_04_11_757637.svg)

Instead of starting OpenRAG using Docker commands and manually editing values in the `.env` file, the TUI walks you through the setup. It prompts for variables where required, creates a `.env` file for you, and then starts OpenRAG.

Once OpenRAG is running, use the TUI to monitor your application, control your containers, and retrieve logs.

If you prefer running Podman or Docker containers and manually editing `.env` files, see [Install OpenRAG Containers](/get-started/docker).

## Prerequisites

- Install [Python Version 3.10 to 3.13](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)
- Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- Install [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation) (recommended) or [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). If using Podman, use [podman-compose](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-compose.1.html) or alias Docker compose commands to Podman commands.
- Create an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). This key is **required** to start OpenRAG, but you can choose a different model provider during [Application Onboarding](#application-onboarding).
- Optional: Install GPU support with an NVIDIA GPU, [CUDA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/) support, and compatible NVIDIA drivers on the OpenRAG host machine. If you don't have GPU capabilities, OpenRAG provides an alternate CPU-only deployment.

## Install OpenRAG {#install}

:::note Windows users
To use OpenRAG on Windows, use [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
:::

Choose an installation method based on your needs:

* For new users, the automatic installer script detects and installs prerequisites and then runs OpenRAG. 
* For a quick test, use `uvx` to run OpenRAG without creating a project or modifying files.
* Use `uv add` to install OpenRAG as a managed dependency in a new or existing Python project.
* Use `uv pip install` to install OpenRAG into an existing virtual environment.

<Tabs groupId="Installation method">
  <TabItem value="installer" label="Automatic installer" default>

    The script detects and installs uv, Docker/Podman, and Docker Compose prerequisites, then runs OpenRAG with `uvx`.

    1. Create a directory to store the OpenRAG configuration files:
       ```bash
       mkdir openrag-workspace
       cd openrag-workspace
       ```

    2. Run the installer:
       ```bash
       curl -fsSL https://docs.openr.ag/files/run_openrag_with_prereqs.sh | bash
       ```

    The TUI creates a `.env` file and docker-compose files in the current working directory.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="uvx" label="Quick test with uvx">

    Use `uvx` to quickly run OpenRAG without creating a project or modifying any files.

    1. Create a directory to store the OpenRAG configuration files:
       ```bash
       mkdir openrag-workspace
       cd openrag-workspace
       ```

    2. Run OpenRAG:
       ```bash
       uvx openrag
       ```

       To run a specific version:
       ```bash
       uvx --from openrag==0.1.30 openrag
       ```

    The TUI creates a `.env` file and docker-compose files in the current working directory.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="uv-add" label="Python project with uv add">

    Use `uv add` to install OpenRAG as a dependency in your Python project. This adds OpenRAG to your `pyproject.toml` and lockfile, making your installation reproducible and version-controlled.

    1. Create a new project with a virtual environment:
       ```bash
       uv init YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
       cd YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
       ```

       The `(venv)` prompt doesn't change, but `uv` commands will automatically use the project's virtual environment.

    2. Add OpenRAG to your project:
       ```bash
       uv add openrag
       ```

       To add a specific version:
       ```bash
       uv add openrag==0.1.30
       ```

    3. Start the OpenRAG TUI:
       ```bash
       uv run openrag
       ```

    <details closed>
      <summary>Install a local wheel</summary>
      
      If you downloaded the OpenRAG wheel to your local machine, install it by specifying its path:

      1. Add the wheel to your project:
         ```bash
         uv add PATH/TO/openrag-VERSION-py3-none-any.whl
         ```

         Replace `PATH/TO/` and `VERSION` with the path and version of your downloaded OpenRAG `.whl` file.

      2. Run OpenRAG:
         ```bash
         uv run openrag
         ```
    </details>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="uv-pip" label="Existing virtual environment with uv pip install">

    Use `uv pip install` to install OpenRAG into an existing virtual environment that isn't managed by `uv`.

    :::tip
    For new projects, `uv add` is recommended as it manages dependencies in your project's lockfile.
    :::

    1. Activate your virtual environment.

    2. Install OpenRAG:
       ```bash
       uv pip install openrag
       ```

    3. Run OpenRAG:
       ```bash
       openrag
       ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Continue with [Set up OpenRAG with the TUI](#setup).

## Set up OpenRAG with the TUI {#setup}

The TUI creates a `.env` file in your OpenRAG directory root and starts OpenRAG.
If the TUI detects a `.env` file in the OpenRAG root directory, it sources any variables from the `.env` file.
If the TUI detects OAuth credentials, it enforces the **Advanced Setup** path.

<Tabs groupId="Setup method">
  <TabItem value="Basic setup" label="Basic setup" default>

    **Basic Setup** can generate all of the required values for OpenRAG except the OpenAI API key.
    **Basic Setup** does not set up OAuth connections for ingestion from cloud providers.
    For OAuth setup, use **Advanced Setup**.
    For information about the difference between basic (no auth) and OAuth in OpenRAG, see [Authentication and document access](/knowledge#auth).

   1. To install OpenRAG with **Basic Setup**, click **Basic Setup** or press <kbd>1</kbd>. 
   2. Click **Generate Passwords** to generate passwords for OpenSearch and Langflow.
   
       The OpenSearch password is required. The Langflow admin password is optional.
       If no Langflow admin password is generated, Langflow runs in [autologin mode](https://docs.langflow.org/api-keys-and-authentication#langflow-auto-login) with no password required.
   
   3. Paste your OpenAI API key in the OpenAI API key field.
   4. Click **Save Configuration**.
   Your passwords are saved in the `.env` file used to start OpenRAG.
   5. To start OpenRAG, click **Start All Services**.
      Startup pulls container images and runs them, so it can take some time.
      When startup is complete, the TUI displays the following:
      ```bash
      Services started successfully
      Command completed successfully
      ```
   6. To start the Docling service, under **Native Services**, click **Start**.
   7. To open the OpenRAG application, navigate to the TUI main menu, and then click **Open App**.
   Alternatively, in your browser, navigate to `localhost:3000`.
   8. Continue with [Application Onboarding](#application-onboarding).
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Advanced setup" label="Advanced setup">

   1. To install OpenRAG with **Advanced Setup**, click **Advanced Setup** or press <kbd>2</kbd>. 
   2. Click **Generate Passwords** to generate passwords for OpenSearch and Langflow.
   
       The OpenSearch password is required. The Langflow admin password is optional.
       If no Langflow admin password is generated, Langflow runs in [autologin mode](https://docs.langflow.org/api-keys-and-authentication#langflow-auto-login) with no password required.
   
   3. Paste your OpenAI API key in the OpenAI API key field.
   4. Add your client and secret values for Google or Microsoft OAuth.
   These values can be found with your OAuth provider.
   For more information, see the [Google OAuth client](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) or [Microsoft Graph OAuth client](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/rest-api/getting-started/graph-oauth) documentation.
   5. The OpenRAG TUI presents redirect URIs for your OAuth app.
   These are the URLs your OAuth provider will redirect back to after user sign-in.
   Register these redirect values with your OAuth provider as they are presented in the TUI.
   6. Click **Save Configuration**.
   7. To start OpenRAG, click **Start All Services**.
      Startup pulls container images and runs them, so it can take some time.
      When startup is complete, the TUI displays the following:
      ```bash
      Services started successfully
      Command completed successfully
      ```
   8. To start the Docling service, under **Native Services**, click **Start**.
   9. To open the OpenRAG application, navigate to the TUI main menu, and then click **Open App**.
   Alternatively, in your browser, navigate to `localhost:3000`.
   You are presented with your provider's OAuth sign-in screen.
   After sign-in, you are redirected to the redirect URI.

       Two additional variables are available for Advanced Setup:

       The `LANGFLOW_PUBLIC_URL` controls where the Langflow web interface can be accessed. This is where users interact with their flows in a browser.

       The `WEBHOOK_BASE_URL` controls where the endpoint for `/connectors/CONNECTOR_TYPE/webhook` will be available.
       This connection enables real-time document synchronization with external services.
       Supported webhook endpoints:
       - Google Drive: `/connectors/google_drive/webhook`
       - OneDrive: `/connectors/onedrive/webhook`  
       - SharePoint: `/connectors/sharepoint/webhook`
       
   10. Continue with [Application Onboarding](#application-onboarding).

## Close the OpenRAG TUI

To close the OpenRAG TUI, press <kbd>q</kbd>.
The OpenRAG containers will continue to be served until the containers are stopped.
For more information, see [Manage OpenRAG containers with the TUI ](#tui-container-management).

To start the TUI again, run `uv run openrag`.

## Manage OpenRAG containers with the TUI {#tui-container-management}

After installation, the TUI can deploy, manage, and upgrade your OpenRAG containers.

### Start all services

Click **Start All Services** to start the OpenRAG containers.
The TUI automatically detects your container runtime, and then checks if your machine has compatible GPU support by checking for `CUDA`, `NVIDIA_SMI`, and Docker/Podman runtime support. This check determines which Docker Compose file OpenRAG uses.
The TUI then pulls the images and deploys the containers with the following command.
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

If images are missing, the TUI runs `docker compose pull`, then runs `docker compose up -d`.

### Status

The **Status** menu displays information on your container deployment.
Here you can check container health, find your service ports, view logs, and upgrade your containers.

To view streaming logs, select the container you want to view, and press <kbd>l</kbd>.
To copy your logs, click **Copy to Clipboard**.

To **upgrade** your containers, click **Upgrade**.
**Upgrade** runs `docker compose pull` and then `docker compose up -d --force-recreate`.
The first command pulls the latest images of OpenRAG.
The second command recreates the containers with your data persisted.

To **reset** your containers, click **Reset**.
Reset gives you a completely fresh start.
Reset deletes all of your data, including OpenSearch data, uploaded documents, and authentication.
**Reset** runs two commands.
It first stops and removes all containers, volumes, and local images.
```
docker compose down --volumes --remove-orphans --rmi local
```

When the first command is complete, OpenRAG removes any additional Docker objects with `prune`.

```
docker system prune -f
```

### Native services status

A _native service_ in OpenRAG refers to a service run locally on your machine, and not within a container.
The `docling serve` process is a native service in OpenRAG, because it's a document processing service that is run on your local machine, and controlled separately from the containers.

To start or stop `docling serve` or any other native services, in the TUI Status menu, click **Stop** or **Restart**.

To view the status, port, or PID of a native service, in the TUI main menu, click [Status](#status).

## Diagnostics

The **Diagnostics** menu provides health monitoring for your container runtimes and monitoring of your OpenSearch security.

## Reinstall OpenRAG {#reinstall}

To reinstall OpenRAG with a completely fresh setup:

1. Reset your containers using the **Reset** button in the [TUI status](#status) menu.
   This removes all containers, volumes, and data.

2. Optional: Delete your project's `.env` file.
   The Reset operation does not remove your project's `.env` file, so your passwords, API keys, and OAuth settings can be preserved.
   If you delete the `.env` file, run the [Set up OpenRAG with the TUI](#setup) process again to create a new configuration.

3. In the TUI Setup menu, follow these steps from [Basic Setup](#setup):
   1. Click **Start All Services** to pull container images and start them.
   2. Under **Native Services**, click **Start** to start the Docling service.
   3. Click **Open App** to open the OpenRAG application.
   4. Continue with [Application Onboarding](#application-onboarding).
