:::tip
To quickly install and test OpenRAG's core features, try the [quickstart](/quickstart).
:::

The installer script installs `uv`, Docker or Podman, Docker Compose, and OpenRAG.
Then, it installs and runs OpenRAG with `uvx`.

When you install OpenRAG with the installer script, you will use the [Terminal User Interface (TUI)](/tui) to configure and manage your OpenRAG deployment.

This installation method is best for testing OpenRAG by running it outside of a Python project.
For other installation methods, see [Select an installation method](/install-options).

## Prerequisites

## Run the installer script {#install}

1. Create a directory to store your OpenRAG configuration files and data, and then change to that directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir openrag-workspace
   cd openrag-workspace
   ```

2. Get and run the installer script:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://docs.openr.ag/files/run_openrag_with_prereqs.sh | bash
   ```

   The installer script installs OpenRAG with [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/#running-tools) in the directory where you run the script.

3. Wait while the installer script prepares your environment and installs OpenRAG.
You might be prompted to install certain dependencies if they aren't already present in your environment.

   The entire process can take a few minutes.
   Once the environment is ready, the OpenRAG TUI starts.

   Because the installer script uses `uvx`, it creates a cached, ephemeral environment in your local `uv` cache, and your OpenRAG configuration files and data are stored separately from the `uv` cache.
   Clearing the cache doesn't delete your entire OpenRAG installation, only the temporary TUI environment.
   After clearing the cache, run `uvx openrag` to [access the TUI](/tui) and continue with your preserved configuration and data.

If you encounter errors during installation, see [Troubleshoot OpenRAG](/support/troubleshoot).

## Set up OpenRAG with the TUI {#setup}

When you install OpenRAG with the installer script, you manage the OpenRAG services with the TUI.
The TUI guides you through the initial configuration process before you start the OpenRAG services.

Your configuration values are stored in an [OpenRAG `.env` file](/reference/configuration) that is created automatically at `~/.openrag/tui`.
If OpenRAG detects an existing `.env` file in this directory, then the TUI can populate those values automatically during setup and onboarding.

Container definitions are stored in the `docker-compose` files in the same directory as the OpenRAG `.env` file.
