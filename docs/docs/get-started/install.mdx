[Install OpenRAG](#install) and then run the [OpenRAG Terminal User Interface(TUI)](#setup) to start your OpenRAG deployment with a guided setup process.

The OpenRAG Terminal User Interface (TUI) allows you to set up, configure, and monitor your OpenRAG deployment directly from the terminal.

![OpenRAG TUI Interface](@site/static/img/OpenRAG_TUI_2025-09-10T13_04_11_757637.svg)

Instead of starting OpenRAG using Docker commands and manually editing values in the `.env` file, the TUI walks you through the setup. It prompts for variables where required, creates a `.env` file for you, and then starts OpenRAG.

Once OpenRAG is running, use the TUI to monitor your application, control your containers, and retrieve logs.

If you prefer running Podman or Docker containers and manually editing `.env` files, see [Install OpenRAG Containers](/docker).

## Prerequisites

- All OpenRAG installations require [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/) version 3.13 or later.

- If you aren't using the automatic installer script, install the following:

   - [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
   - [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation) (recommended) or [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
   - [`podman-compose`](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-compose.1.html) or [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). To use Docker Compose with Podman, you must alias Docker Compose commands to Podman commands.

- Microsoft Windows only: To run OpenRAG on Windows, you must use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

   </details>

- Prepare model providers and credentials.

   During [Application Onboarding](#application-onboarding), you must select language model and embedding model providers.
   If your chosen provider offers both types, you can use the same provider for both selections.
   If your provider offers only one type, such as Anthropic, you must select two providers.

   Gather the credentials and connection details for your chosen model providers before starting onboarding:

   - OpenAI: Create an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
   - Anthropic language models: Create an [Anthropic API key](https://www.anthropic.com/docs/api/reference).
   - IBM watsonx.ai: Get your watsonx.ai API endpoint, IBM project ID, and IBM API key from your watsonx deployment.
   - Ollama: Use the [Ollama documentation](https://docs.ollama.com/) to set up your Ollama instance locally, in the cloud, or on a remote server, and then get your Ollama server's base URL.

- Optional: Install GPU support with an NVIDIA GPU, [CUDA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/) support, and compatible NVIDIA drivers on the OpenRAG host machine. If you don't have GPU capabilities, OpenRAG provides an alternate CPU-only deployment.

## Install OpenRAG {#install}

Choose an installation method based on your needs:

* For new users, the automatic installer script detects and installs prerequisites and then runs OpenRAG. 
* For a quick test, use `uvx` to run OpenRAG without creating a project or modifying files.
* Use `uv add` to install OpenRAG as a managed dependency in a new or existing Python project.
* Use `uv pip install` to install OpenRAG into an existing virtual environment.

<Tabs groupId="Installation method">
  <TabItem value="installer" label="Automatic installer" default>

    The script detects and installs uv, Docker/Podman, and Docker Compose prerequisites, then runs OpenRAG with `uvx`.

    1. Create a directory to store the OpenRAG configuration files:
       ```bash
       mkdir openrag-workspace
       cd openrag-workspace
       ```

    2. Run the installer:
       ```bash
       curl -fsSL https://docs.openr.ag/files/run_openrag_with_prereqs.sh | bash
       ```

    The TUI creates a `.env` file and docker-compose files in the current working directory.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="uvx" label="Quick test with uvx">

    Use `uvx` to quickly run OpenRAG without creating a project or modifying any files.

    1. Create a directory to store the OpenRAG configuration files:
       ```bash
       mkdir openrag-workspace
       cd openrag-workspace
       ```

    2. Run OpenRAG:
       ```bash
       uvx openrag
       ```

       To run a specific version:
       ```bash
       uvx --from openrag==0.1.30 openrag
       ```

    The TUI creates a `.env` file and docker-compose files in the current working directory.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="uv-add" label="Python project with uv add">

    Use `uv add` to install OpenRAG as a dependency in your Python project. This adds OpenRAG to your `pyproject.toml` and lockfile, making your installation reproducible and version-controlled.

    1. Create a new project with a virtual environment:
       ```bash
       uv init YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
       cd YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
       ```

       The `(venv)` prompt doesn't change, but `uv` commands will automatically use the project's virtual environment.

    2. Add OpenRAG to your project:
       ```bash
       uv add openrag
       ```

       To add a specific version:
       ```bash
       uv add openrag==0.1.30
       ```

    3. Start the OpenRAG TUI:
       ```bash
       uv run openrag
       ```

    <details closed>
      <summary>Install a local wheel</summary>
      
      If you downloaded the OpenRAG wheel to your local machine, install it by specifying its path:

      1. Add the wheel to your project:
         ```bash
         uv add PATH/TO/openrag-VERSION-py3-none-any.whl
         ```

         Replace `PATH/TO/` and `VERSION` with the path and version of your downloaded OpenRAG `.whl` file.

      2. Run OpenRAG:
         ```bash
         uv run openrag
         ```
    </details>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="uv-pip" label="Existing virtual environment with uv pip install">

    Use `uv pip install` to install OpenRAG into an existing virtual environment that isn't managed by `uv`.

    :::tip
    For new projects, `uv add` is recommended as it manages dependencies in your project's lockfile.
    :::

    1. Activate your virtual environment.

    2. Install OpenRAG:
       ```bash
       uv pip install openrag
       ```

    3. Run OpenRAG:
       ```bash
       uv run openrag

</Tabs>

Continue with [Set up OpenRAG with the TUI](#setup).

If you encounter errors during installation, see [Troubleshoot OpenRAG](/support/troubleshoot).

## Set up OpenRAG with the TUI {#setup}

The TUI creates a `.env` file in your OpenRAG directory root and starts OpenRAG.
If the TUI detects a `.env` file in the OpenRAG root directory, it sources any variables from the `.env` file.
If the TUI detects OAuth credentials, it enforces the **Advanced Setup** path.

<Tabs groupId="Setup method">
  <TabItem value="Basic setup" label="Basic setup" default>

    **Basic Setup** can generate all of the required values for OpenRAG. The OpenAI API key is optional and can be provided during onboarding.
    **Basic Setup** does not set up OAuth connections for ingestion from cloud providers.
    For OAuth setup, use **Advanced Setup**.
    For information about the difference between basic (no auth) and OAuth in OpenRAG, see [Authentication and document access](/knowledge#auth).

   1. To install OpenRAG with **Basic Setup**, click **Basic Setup** or press <kbd>1</kbd>. 
   2. Click **Generate Passwords** to generate passwords for OpenSearch and Langflow.
   
       The OpenSearch password is required. The Langflow admin password is optional.
       If no Langflow admin password is generated, Langflow runs in [autologin mode](https://docs.langflow.org/api-keys-and-authentication#langflow-auto-login) with no password required.
   
   3. Optional: Paste your OpenAI API key in the OpenAI API key field. You can also provide this during onboarding or choose a different model provider.
   4. Click **Save Configuration**.
   Your passwords are saved in the `.env` file used to start OpenRAG.
   5. To start OpenRAG, click **Start All Services**.
      Startup pulls container images and runs them, so it can take some time.
      When startup is complete, the TUI displays the following:
      ```bash
      Services started successfully
      Command completed successfully
      ```
   6. To start the Docling service, under **Native Services**, click **Start**.
   7. To open the OpenRAG application, navigate to the TUI main menu, and then click **Open App**.
   Alternatively, in your browser, navigate to `localhost:3000`.
   8. Continue with [Application Onboarding](#application-onboarding).
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Advanced setup" label="Advanced setup">

   1. To install OpenRAG with **Advanced Setup**, click **Advanced Setup** or press <kbd>2</kbd>. 
   2. Click **Generate Passwords** to generate passwords for OpenSearch and Langflow.
   
       The OpenSearch password is required. The Langflow admin password is optional.
       If no Langflow admin password is generated, Langflow runs in [autologin mode](https://docs.langflow.org/api-keys-and-authentication#langflow-auto-login) with no password required.
   
   3. Paste your OpenAI API key in the OpenAI API key field.
   4. Add your client and secret values for Google or Microsoft OAuth.
   These values can be found with your OAuth provider.
   For more information, see the [Google OAuth client](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) or [Microsoft Graph OAuth client](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/rest-api/getting-started/graph-oauth) documentation.
   5. The OpenRAG TUI presents redirect URIs for your OAuth app.
   These are the URLs your OAuth provider will redirect back to after user sign-in.
   Register these redirect values with your OAuth provider as they are presented in the TUI.
   6. Click **Save Configuration**.
   7. To start OpenRAG, click **Start All Services**.
      Startup pulls container images and runs them, so it can take some time.
      When startup is complete, the TUI displays the following:
      ```bash
      Services started successfully
      Command completed successfully
      ```
   8. To start the Docling service, under **Native Services**, click **Start**.
   9. To open the OpenRAG application, navigate to the TUI main menu, and then click **Open App**.
   Alternatively, in your browser, navigate to `localhost:3000`.
   You are presented with your provider's OAuth sign-in screen.
   After sign-in, you are redirected to the redirect URI.

       Two additional variables are available for Advanced Setup:

       The `LANGFLOW_PUBLIC_URL` controls where the Langflow web interface can be accessed. This is where users interact with their flows in a browser.

       The `WEBHOOK_BASE_URL` controls where the endpoint for `/connectors/CONNECTOR_TYPE/webhook` will be available.
       This connection enables real-time document synchronization with external services.
       Supported webhook endpoints:
       - Google Drive: `/connectors/google_drive/webhook`
       - OneDrive: `/connectors/onedrive/webhook`
       - SharePoint: `/connectors/sharepoint/webhook`

   10. Continue with [Application Onboarding](#application-onboarding).
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Exit the OpenRAG TUI

To exit the OpenRAG TUI, navigate to the main menu, and then press <kbd>q</kbd>.
The OpenRAG containers continue to run until they are stopped.
For more information, see [Manage OpenRAG containers with the TUI ](#tui-container-management).

To relaunch the TUI, run `uv run openrag`.
If you installed OpenRAG with `uvx`, run `uvx openrag`.

## Manage OpenRAG containers with the TUI {#tui-container-management}

After installation, the TUI can deploy, manage, and upgrade your OpenRAG containers.

### Diagnostics

The **Diagnostics** menu provides health monitoring for your container runtimes and monitoring of your OpenSearch security.

### Status {#status}

The **Status** menu displays information on your container deployment.
Here you can check container health, find your service ports, view logs, and upgrade your containers.

* **Logs**: To view streaming logs, select the container you want to view, and press <kbd>l</kbd>.
To copy the logs, click **Copy to Clipboard**.

* **Upgrade**: Use this option when you [upgrade OpenRAG](#upgrade).

* **Reset**: This is a destructive action that [resets your containers](#reset-containers).

* **Native services**: From the **Status** menu, you can view the status, port, and process ID (PID) of the OpenRAG native services.
You can also click **Stop** or **Restart** to stop and start OpenRAG native services.

    A _native service_ in OpenRAG is a service that runs locally on your machine, not within a container. For example, the `docling serve` process is an OpenRAG native service because this document processing service runs on your local machine, separate from the OpenRAG containers.

### Reset containers {#reset-containers}

:::warning
This is a destructive action that deletes all of your OpenRAG container data, including OpenSearch data, uploaded documents, and customized flows.
:::

To destroy and recreate your OpenRAG containers, go to the TUI [**Status** menu](#status), and then click **Reset**.

The **Reset** function runs two commands. First, it stops and removes all containers, volumes, and local images:

```bash
docker compose down --volumes --remove-orphans --rmi local
```

Then, it removes any additional Docker objects with `docker system prune -f`.

If you reset your containers as part of reinstalling OpenRAG, continue the [reinstallation process](#reinstall) after resetting the containers.

### Start all services

On the TUI main page, click **Start All Services** to start the OpenRAG containers and launch OpenRAG itself.

When you start all services, the following processes happen:

1. OpenRAG automatically detects your container runtime, and then checks if your machine has compatible GPU support by checking for `CUDA`, `NVIDIA_SMI`, and Docker/Podman runtime support. This check determines which Docker Compose file OpenRAG uses.

2. OpenRAG pulls the OpenRAG container images with `docker compose pull` if any images are missing.

3. OpenRAG deploys the containers with `docker compose up -d`.

## Upgrade OpenRAG {#upgrade}

To upgrade OpenRAG, upgrade the OpenRAG Python package, and then upgrade the OpenRAG containers.

This is a two part process because upgrading the OpenRAG Python package updates the TUI and Python code, but the container versions are controlled by environment variables in your `.env` file.

1. Upgrade the OpenRAG Python package to the latest version from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/openrag/).

    <Tabs groupId="Installation method">
    <TabItem value="installer" label="Automatic installer or uvx" default>

    Use these steps to upgrade the Python package if you installed OpenRAG using the automatic installer or `uvx`:

    1. Navigate to your OpenRAG workspace directory:

        ```bash
        cd openrag-workspace
        ```

    2. Upgrade the OpenRAG package:

        ```bash
        uvx --from openrag openrag
        ```

        To upgrade to a specific version:

        ```bash
        uvx --from openrag==0.1.33 openrag
        ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="uv-add" label="Python project (uv add)">

    Use these steps to upgrade the Python package if you installed OpenRAG in a Python project with `uv add`:

    1. Navigate to your project directory:

        ```bash
        cd YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
        ```

    2. Update OpenRAG to the latest version:

        ```bash
        uv add --upgrade openrag
        ```

        To upgrade to a specific version:

        ```bash
        uv add --upgrade openrag==0.1.33
        ```

    3. Start the OpenRAG TUI:

        ```bash
        uv run openrag
        ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="uv-pip" label="Virtual environment (uv pip install)">

    Use these steps to upgrade the Python package if you installed OpenRAG in a venv with `uv pip install`:

    1. Activate your virtual environment.

    2. Upgrade OpenRAG:

        ```bash
        uv pip install --upgrade openrag
        ```

        To upgrade to a specific version:

        ```bash
        uv pip install --upgrade openrag==0.1.33
        ```

    3. Start the OpenRAG TUI:

        ```bash
        uv run openrag
        ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

2. Upgrade the OpenRAG containers: In the OpenRAG TUI, click **Status**, click **Upgrade**, and then wait while the containers are upgraded.

    **Upgrade** runs `docker compose pull` to get the container images based on the version specified in your `.env` file. Then, it recreates the containers with the new images using `docker compose up -d --force-recreate`.

    `OPENRAG_VERSION` is set to `latest` by default, which it pulls the `latest` available container images.
    To pin a specific container image version, edit the `OPENRAG_VERSION` [environment variable](/reference/configuration#system-settings) in your OpenRAG `.env` file. For example, `OPENRAG_VERSION=0.1.33`.

    If you get an error that `langflow container already exists` error during upgrade, see [Langflow container already exists during upgrade](/support/troubleshoot#langflow-container-already-exists-during-upgrade).

3. When the upgrade process is complete, you can close the **Status** window and continue using OpenRAG.

## Reinstall OpenRAG {#reinstall}

To reinstall OpenRAG with a completely fresh setup:

1. In the TUI **Status** menu, [reset your containers](#reset-containers) to destroy the existing OpenRAG containers and their data.

2. Optional: Delete your project's `.env` file.

    The Reset operation does not remove your project's `.env` file, so your passwords, API keys, and OAuth settings can be preserved.
    If you delete the `.env` file, you must run the [Set up OpenRAG with the TUI](#setup) process again to create a new configuration file.

3. In the TUI **Setup** menu, repeat the [Basic Setup](#setup) process:

    1. Click **Start All Services** to pull container images and start them.
    2. Under **Native Services**, click **Start** to start the Docling service.
    3. Click **Open App** to open the OpenRAG application.
    4. Continue with [Application Onboarding](#application-onboarding).

If reinstalling OpenRAG and deleting the `.env` file doesn't reset setup or onboarding, see [Reinstalling OpenRAG doesn't reset onboarding](/support/troubleshoot#reinstalling-openrag-doesnt-reset-onboarding).
