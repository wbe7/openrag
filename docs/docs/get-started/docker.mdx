To manage your own OpenRAG services, deploy OpenRAG with Docker or Podman.

Use this installation method if you don't want to [use the Terminal User Interface (TUI)](/tui), or you need to run OpenRAG in an environment where using the TUI is unfeasible.

## Prerequisites

<PartialPrereqWindows />

<PartialPrereqPython />

<PartialPrereqNoScript />

<PartialPrereqCommon />

## Prepare your deployment {#setup}

1. Clone the OpenRAG repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/langflow-ai/openrag.git
   ```

2. Change to the root of the cloned repository:

   ```bash
   cd openrag
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file at the root of the cloned repository.

   You can create an empty file or copy the repository's [`.env.example`](https://github.com/langflow-ai/openrag/blob/main/.env.example) file.
   The example file contains some of the [OpenRAG environment variables](/reference/configuration) to get you started with configuring your deployment.

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

5. Edit the `.env` file to configure your deployment using [OpenRAG environment variables](/reference/configuration).
The OpenRAG Docker Compose files pull values from your `.env` file to configure the OpenRAG containers.
The following variables are required or recommended:

   * **`OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD` (Required)**: Sets the OpenSearch administrator password. It must adhere to the [OpenSearch password complexity requirements](https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/security/configuration/demo-configuration/#setting-up-a-custom-admin-password).

   * **`LANGFLOW_SUPERUSER`**: The username for the Langflow administrator user. If `LANGFLOW_SUPERUSER` isn't set, then the default value is `admin`.

   * **`LANGFLOW_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD` (Strongly recommended)**: Sets the Langflow administrator password, and determines the Langflow server's default authentication mode. If `LANGFLOW_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD` isn't set, then the Langflow server starts without authentication enabled. For more information, see [Langflow settings](/reference/configuration#langflow-settings).

   * **`LANGFLOW_SECRET_KEY` (Strongly recommended)**: A secret encryption key for internal Langflow operations. It is recommended to [generate your own Langflow secret key](https://docs.langflow.org/api-keys-and-authentication#langflow-secret-key). If `LANGFLOW_SECRET_KEY` isn't set, then Langflow generates a secret key automatically.

   * **Model provider credentials**: Provide credentials for your preferred model providers. If none of these are set in the `.env` file, you must configure at least one provider during the [application onboarding process](#application-onboarding).

      * `OPENAI_API_KEY`
      * `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
      * `OLLAMA_ENDPOINT`
      * `WATSONX_API_KEY`
      * `WATSONX_ENDPOINT`
      * `WATSONX_PROJECT_ID`

6. To enable [OAuth mode](/knowledge#auth) or [cloud storage connectors](/ingestion#oauth-ingestion), do the following:

   1. In your `.env` file, set the [OAuth environment variables](/reference/configuration#oauth-and-cloud-storage-connector-settings) for the providers that you want to use:

      ```env
      GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=
      GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=

      MICROSOFT_GRAPH_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=
      MICROSOFT_GRAPH_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=

      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
      ```

      <PartialOAuthCredentials />

   2. Optional: Set the `WEBHOOK_BASE_URL` to the base address for your OAuth connector endpoints. If set, the OAuth connector webhook URLs are constructed as `WEBHOOK_BASE_URL/connectors/${provider}/webhook`. This option is required to enable automatic ingestion from cloud storage.

   3. For each provider, you must register an OpenRAG OAuth redirect URI in your cloud service's OAuth configuration.

      For Google, this URL is used to redirect users back to OpenRAG after they sign in, and for the cloud storage connector webhooks.

      For Microsoft and Amazon, this URL is used for the cloud storage connector webhooks.

## Start services

1. To use the default Docling Serve implementation, start `docling serve` on port 5001 on the host machine using the included script:

   ```bash
   uv run python scripts/docling_ctl.py start --port 5001
   ```

   Docling cannot run inside a Docker container due to system-level dependencies, so you must manage it as a separate service on the host machine.
   For more information, see [Stop, start, and inspect native services](/manage-services#start-native-services).

   Port 5001 is required to deploy OpenRAG successfully; don't use a different port.
   Additionally, this enables the [MLX framework](https://opensource.apple.com/projects/mlx/) for accelerated performance on Apple Silicon Mac machines.

   :::tip
   If you don't want to use the default Docling Serve implementation, see [Select a Docling implementation](/knowledge#select-a-docling-implementation).
   :::

2. Confirm `docling serve` is running.

   The following command checks the status of the default Docling Serve implementation:

   ```bash
   uv run python scripts/docling_ctl.py status
   ```

   If `docling serve` is running, the output includes the status, address, and process ID (PID):

   ```bash
   Status: running
   Endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:5001
   Docs: http://127.0.0.1:5001/docs
   PID: 27746
   ```

3. Deploy the OpenRAG containers locally using the appropriate Docker Compose configuration for your environment:

   * **CPU-only deployment (Default and recommended)**: If your host machine doesn't have NVIDIA GPU support, use the base `docker-compose.yml` file:

      ```bash title="Docker"
      docker compose up -d
      ```

      ```bash title="Podman"
      podman compose up -d
      ```

   * **GPU-accelerated deployment**: If your host machine has an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support and compatible NVIDIA drivers, use the base `docker-compose.yml` file with the `docker-compose.gpu.yml` override:

      ```bash title="Docker"
      docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.gpu.yml up -d
      ```

      ```bash title="Podman"
      podman compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.gpu.yml up -d
      ```

   :::tip
   <PartialGpuModeTip />
   :::

4. Wait for the OpenRAG containers to start, and then confirm that all containers are running:

   ```bash title="Docker"
   docker compose ps
   ```

   ```bash title="Podman"
   podman compose ps
   ```

   The OpenRAG Docker Compose files deploy the following containers:

   | Container Name | Default address | Purpose |
   |---|---|---|
   | OpenRAG Backend | http://localhost:8000 | FastAPI server and core functionality. |
   | OpenRAG Frontend | http://localhost:3000 | React web interface for user interaction. |
   | Langflow | http://localhost:7860 | [AI workflow engine](/agents). |
   | OpenSearch | http://localhost:9200 | Datastore for [knowledge](/knowledge). |
   | OpenSearch Dashboards | http://localhost:5601 | OpenSearch database administration interface. |

   When the containers are running, you can access your OpenRAG services at their addresses.

5. Access the OpenRAG frontend at `http://localhost:3000`, and then continue with the [application onboarding process](#application-onboarding).

   If you provided Google OAuth credentials, you must sign in with Google before you are redirected to your OpenRAG instance.
