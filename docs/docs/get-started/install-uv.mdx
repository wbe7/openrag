For guided configuration and simplified container management, install OpenRAG with containers managed by the [Terminal User Interface (TUI)](/tui).

You can use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to install OpenRAG as a managed or unmanaged dependency in a new or existing Python project.

For other installation methods, see [Choose an installation method](/install-options).



    * **`uv pip install`**: Install OpenRAG as an unmanaged dependency in a virtual environment.
    * **`uv add`** (Recommended): Install OpenRAG as a managed dependency in a new or existing Python project.
