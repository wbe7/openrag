title: Install OpenRAG in a Python project with uv
slug: /install-uv
---

For guided configuration and simplified container management, install OpenRAG with containers managed by the [Terminal User Interface (TUI)](/tui).

You can use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to install OpenRAG as a managed or unmanaged dependency in a new or existing Python project.

For other installation methods, see [Choose an installation method](/install-options).



    * **`uv pip install`**: Install OpenRAG as an unmanaged dependency in a virtual environment.
    * **`uv add`** (Recommended): Install OpenRAG as a managed dependency in a new or existing Python project.


## uv add (Recommended)

    Use `uv add` to install OpenRAG as a dependency in your Python project. This adds OpenRAG to your `pyproject.toml` and lockfile, making your installation reproducible and version-controlled.

    1. Create a new project with a virtual environment:
       ```bash
       uv init YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
       cd YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
       ```

       The `(venv)` prompt doesn't change, but `uv` commands will automatically use the project's virtual environment.

    2. Add the OpenRAG package to your project:
       ```bash
       uv add openrag
       ```

       To add a specific version:
       ```bash
       uv add openrag==0.1.30
       ```

       If you downloaded the OpenRAG wheel to your local machine, install OpenRAG by specifying the path and name of the OpenRAG `.whl` file:

       ```bash
       uv add PATH/TO/openrag-VERSION-py3-none-any.whl
       ```

    3. Start the OpenRAG TUI:
       ```bash
       uv run openrag
       ```
If you encounter errors during installation, see [Troubleshoot OpenRAG](/support/troubleshoot).


## uv pip install

    Use `uv pip install` to install OpenRAG into an existing virtual environment that isn't managed by `uv`.

    :::tip
    For new projects, `uv add` is recommended as it manages dependencies in your project's lockfile.
    :::

    1. Activate your virtual environment.

    2. Install OpenRAG:
       ```bash
       uv pip install openrag
       ```

    3. Run OpenRAG:
       ```bash
       uv run openrag
       ```
    If you encounter errors during installation, see [Troubleshoot OpenRAG](/support/troubleshoot).

## Set up OpenRAG with the TUI
<!-- use partial? -->
When the Terminal User Interface (TUI) starts, you must complete the initial setup to configure OpenRAG.
