The [OpenRAG architecture](/#openrag-architecture) is lightweight and container-based with a central OpenRAG backend that orchestrates the various services and external connectors.
Depending on your use case, OpenRAG can assist with container management, or you can manage the containers yourself.

Choose the installation method that best fits your needs:

* **Use the [Terminal User Interface (TUI)](/tui) to manage containers**: For guided configuration and simplified container management, install OpenRAG with TUI-managed containers.

    * [**Automatic installer script**](/install): Run one script to install the required dependencies and install OpenRAG with `uvx`.
    * [**`uv`**](/install-uv): Install OpenRAG as a dependency of a new or existing Python project.
    * [**`uvx`**](/install-uvx): Invoke OpenRAG without permanently installing it in a Python project.

* [**Install OpenRAG on Microsoft Windows**](/install-wsl): On Windows machines, you must install OpenRAG within the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

   OpenRAG doesn't support nested virtualization; don't run OpenRAG on a WSL distribution that is inside a Windows VM.

* [**Manage your own containers**](/docker): You can use Docker or Podman to deploy self-managed OpenRAG containers.

The first time you start OpenRAG, you must complete application onboarding.
This is required for all installation methods because it prepares the minimum required configuration for OpenRAG to run.
For more information, see the instructions for your chosen installation method.

Your OpenRAG configuration is stored in a `.env` file in the OpenRAG installation directory.
When using TUI-managed containers, the TUI prompts you for any missing values during setup and onboarding, and any values detected in a preexisting `.env` file are automatically populated.
When using self-managed containers, you must predefine these values in a `.env` file, as you would for any container deployment.
For more information, see the instructions for your chosen installation method and [Environment variables](/reference/configuration).
