The OpenRAG Terminal User Interface (TUI) provides a simplified and guided experience for configuring, managing, and monitoring your OpenRAG deployment directly from the terminal.

![OpenRAG TUI Interface](@site/static/img/openrag_tui_dec_2025.png)

If you install OpenRAG with the [automatic installer script](/install), [`uv`](/install-uv), or [`uvx`](/install-uvx), you use the TUI to manage your OpenRAG deployment.
The TUI guides you through the initial setup, automatically manages your OpenRAG `.env` and `docker-compose` files, and provides convenient access to [service management](/manage-services) controls.

In contrast, when you [deploy OpenRAG with self-managed services](/docker), you must manually configure OpenRAG by preparing a `.env` file, and then use Docker or Podman commands to deploy and manage your OpenRAG services.

## Access the TUI {#access-the-tui}

If you installed OpenRAG with `uv`, access the TUI with `uv run openrag`.

If you installed OpenRAG with the automatic installer script or `uvx`, access the TUI with `uvx openrag`.

You can navigate the TUI with your mouse or keyboard.
Keyboard shortcuts for additional menus are printed at the bottom of the TUI screen.

## Manage services with the TUI

:::tip
A Docker or Podman VM must be running before you start OpenRAG.

For example, on macOS with Podman, open the Podman Desktop app before you start OpenRAG.
:::

In the TUI, click **Start OpenRAG** to start the OpenRAG services.

Use the TUI's **Status** page to access controls and information for your OpenRAG services.

For more information, see [Manage OpenRAG services](/manage-services).

## Toggle GPU/CPU mode

You can toggle between GPU and CPU mode from within the TUI if your system has compatible GPU hardware and drivers installed.

In the TUI, click **Status**, and then click **Switch to GPU Mode** or **Switch to CPU Mode**.

This change requires restarting all OpenRAG services because each mode has its own `docker-compose` file.

## Exit the OpenRAG TUI

To exit the OpenRAG TUI, press <kbd>q</kbd> on the TUI main page.

Exiting the TUI doesn't stop your OpenRAG services.
Your OpenRAG services continue to run until they are stopped from within the TUI or by another process that inadvertently stops them.

To restart the TUI, see [Access the TUI](#access-the-tui).
