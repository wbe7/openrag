The OpenRAG Terminal User Interface (TUI) provides a simplified and guided experience for configuring, managing, and monitoring your OpenRAG deployment directly from the terminal.

![OpenRAG TUI Interface](@site/static/img/OpenRAG_TUI_2025-09-10T13_04_11_757637.svg)

The TUI is used when you install OpenRAG with the [automatic installer script](/install), [`uv`](/install-uv), or [`uvx`](/install-uvx).
It guides you through the initial setup, creates your `.env` file automatically, and provides convenient access to [container management](/manage-containers) controls.

In contrast, when you [deploy OpenRAG with self-managed containers](/docker), you must manually configure OpenRAG by preparing a `.env` file and using Docker or Podman commands to deploy and manage your containers.

## Access the TUI {#access-the-tui}

If you installed OpenRAG with `uv`, access the TUI with `uv run openrag`.

If you installed OpenRAG with the automatic installer script or `uvx`, access the TUI with `uvx openrag`.

## Exit the OpenRAG TUI

To exit the OpenRAG TUI, go to the TUI main menu, and then press <kbd>q</kbd>.

Your OpenRAG containers continue to run until they are stopped.

To restart the TUI, see [Access the TUI](#access-the-tui).
