Use these steps to upgrade your OpenRAG deployment to the latest version or a specific version.

## Upgrade TUI-managed containers

To upgrade OpenRAG, you need to upgrade the OpenRAG Python package, and then upgrade the OpenRAG containers.

This is a two part process because upgrading the OpenRAG Python package updates the TUI and Python code, but the container versions are controlled by environment variables in your `.env` file.

1. Stop your OpenRAG containers: In the OpenRAG TUI, go to the **Status** menu, and then click **Stop Services**.

2. Upgrade the OpenRAG Python package to the latest version from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/openrag/).

    <Tabs groupId="Installation method">
    <TabItem value="installer" label="Automatic installer or uvx" default>

    Use these steps to upgrade the Python package if you installed OpenRAG using the automatic installer or `uvx`:

    1. Navigate to your OpenRAG workspace directory:

        ```bash
        cd openrag-workspace
        ```

    2. Upgrade the OpenRAG package:

        ```bash
        uvx --from openrag openrag
        ```

        To upgrade to a specific version:

        ```bash
        uvx --from openrag==0.1.33 openrag
        ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="uv-add" label="Python project (uv add)">

    Use these steps to upgrade the Python package if you installed OpenRAG in a Python project with `uv add`:

    1. Navigate to your project directory:

        ```bash
        cd YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
        ```

    2. Update OpenRAG to the latest version:

        ```bash
        uv add --upgrade openrag
        ```

        To upgrade to a specific version:

        ```bash
        uv add --upgrade openrag==0.1.33
        ```

    3. Start the OpenRAG TUI:

        ```bash
        uv run openrag
        ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="uv-pip" label="Virtual environment (uv pip install)">

    Use these steps to upgrade the Python package if you installed OpenRAG in a venv with `uv pip install`:

    1. Activate your virtual environment.

    2. Upgrade OpenRAG:

        ```bash
        uv pip install --upgrade openrag
        ```

        To upgrade to a specific version:

        ```bash
        uv pip install --upgrade openrag==0.1.33
        ```

    3. Start the OpenRAG TUI:

        ```bash
        uv run openrag
        ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

3. Start the upgraded OpenRAG containers: In the OpenRAG TUI, click **Start All Services**, and then wait while the containers start.

    After upgrading the Python package, OpenRAG runs `docker compose pull` to get the appropriate container images matching the version specified in your OpenRAG `.env` file. Then, it recreates the containers with the new images using `docker compose up -d --force-recreate`.

    In the `.env` file, the `OPENRAG_VERSION` [environment variable](/reference/configuration#system-settings) is set to `latest` by default, which it pulls the `latest` available container images.
    To pin a specific container image version, you can set `OPENRAG_VERSION` to the desired container image version, such as `OPENRAG_VERSION=0.1.33`.

    However, when you upgrade the Python package, OpenRAG automatically attempts to keep the `OPENRAG_VERSION` synchronized with the Python package version.
    You might need to edit the `.env` file after upgrading the Python package to enforce a different container version.
    The TUI warns you if it detects a version mismatch.

    If you get an error that `langflow container already exists` error during upgrade, see [Langflow container already exists during upgrade](/support/troubleshoot#langflow-container-already-exists-during-upgrade).

4. When the upgrade process is complete, you can close the **Status** window and continue using OpenRAG.

## Upgrade self-managed containers

By default, OpenRAG's `docker-compose.yml` file pulls the latest container images that are available when you run `docker compose up -d`.

To fetch and apply the latest container images while preserving your OpenRAG data, run the commands for your container management tool:

* Docker Compose:

    ```bash
    docker compose pull
    docker compose up -d --force-recreate
    ```

* Podman Compose:

    ```bash
    podman-compose pull
    podman-compose up -d --force-recreate
    ```
