:::tip
If you want to reset your OpenRAG containers without removing OpenRAG entirely, see [Reset OpenRAG containers](/manage-containers#reset-containers) and [Reinstall OpenRAG](/reinstall).
:::

If you used the [automated installer script](/install) or [`uvx`](/install-uvx) to install OpenRAG, run `uv cache clean openrag` to remove the cached OpenRAG environment.

If you used [`uv`](/install-uv) to install OpenRAG, run `uv remove openrag` in your Python project.

For self-managed containers, destroy the containers, prune any additional Docker objects, and delete any remaining OpenRAG files, as explained in [Reset OpenRAG containers](/manage-containers#reset-containers).
