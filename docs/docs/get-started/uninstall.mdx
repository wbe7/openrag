:::tip
If you want to reset your OpenRAG containers without removing OpenRAG entirely, see [Reset OpenRAG containers](/manage-services) and [Reinstall OpenRAG](/reinstall).
:::

## Uninstall TUI-managed deployments

If you used the [automated installer script](/install) or [`uvx`](/install-uvx) to install OpenRAG, clear your `uv` cache (`uv cache clean`) to remove the TUI environment, and then delete the `~/.openrag` directory.

If you used [`uv`](/install-uv) to install OpenRAG, run `uv remove openrag` in your Python project, and then delete the `~/.openrag` directory.

## Uninstall self-managed deployments

For self-managed services, destroy the containers, prune any additional container objects, delete any remaining OpenRAG files, and then shut down the Docling service.

### Uninstall with `docker compose` or `podman compose`

Use these steps to uninstall a self-managed OpenRAG deployment with streamlined `docker compose` or `podman compose` commands:

1. Destroy the containers, volumes, and local images, and then remove (prune) any additional container objects:

   <PartialDockerComposeDownAndPrune />

2. Remove OpenRAG's `.env` file and the `~/.openrag/documents` directory, which aren't deleted by the previous commands.

3. Stop `docling-serve`:

   ```bash
   uv run python scripts/docling_ctl.py stop
   ```

### Uninstall with discrete `docker` or `podman` commands

Use these commands to uninstall a self-managed OpenRAG deployment with discrete `docker` or `podman` commands:

1. Stop all running containers:

   <PartialDockerStopAll />

2. Remove and clean up containers:

   <PartialDockerRemoveAndCleanupSteps />

3. Remove OpenRAG's `.env` file and the `~/.openrag/documents` directory, which aren't deleted by the previous commands.

4. Stop `docling-serve`:

   ```bash
   uv run python scripts/docling_ctl.py stop
   ```
