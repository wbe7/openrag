Use this quickstart to install OpenRAG, and then try some of OpenRAG's core features.

## Prerequisites

<PartialPrereqPython />

* Get an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
This quickstart uses OpenAI for simplicity.
For other providers, see the other [installation methods](/install-options).

<PartialPrereqWindows />

## Install OpenRAG

For this quickstart, install OpenRAG with the automatic installer script and basic setup.
The script installs OpenRAG dependencies, including Docker or Podman, and then it installs and runs OpenRAG with [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/#running-tools).

1. Create a directory for your OpenRAG installation, and then change to that directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir openrag-workspace
   cd openrag-workspace
   ```

2. Download and run the OpenRAG install script:

   ```bash
   curl -O https://docs.openr.ag/files/run_openrag_with_prereqs.sh
   bash run_openrag_with_prereqs.sh
   ```

3. Wait while the installer script prepares your environment and installs OpenRAG.
   You might be prompted to install certain dependencies if they aren't already present in your environment.

   The entire process can take a few minutes.
   Once the environment is ready, the OpenRAG [Terminal User Interface (TUI)](/tui) starts.

   ![OpenRAG TUI Interface](@site/static/img/openrag_tui_dec_2025.png)

4. In the TUI, click **Basic Setup**.

5. For **Langflow Admin Password**, click **Generate Password** to create a Langflow administrator password and username.

6. Use the default values for all other fields.

7. Click **Save Configuration**.

   Your OpenRAG configuration and passwords are stored in an [OpenRAG `.env` file](/reference/configuration) file that is created automatically at `~/.openrag/tui`.
   OpenRAG container definitions are stored in the `docker-compose` files in the same directory.

8. Click **Start OpenRAG** to start the OpenRAG services.

   This process can take some time while OpenRAG pulls and runs the container images.
   If all services start successfully, the TUI prints a confirmation message:

   ```text
   Services started successfully
   Command completed successfully
   ```

9. Click **Close**, and then click **Launch OpenRAG** to access the OpenRAG application and start the application onboarding process.

10. For this quickstart, select the **OpenAI** model provider, enter your OpenAI API key, and then click **Complete**. Use the default settings for all other model options.

11. Click through the overview slides for a brief introduction to OpenRAG, or click <Icon name="ArrowRight" aria-hidden="true"/> **Skip overview**.
You can complete this quickstart without going through the overview.
The overview demonstrates some basic functionality that is covered in the next section and in other parts of the OpenRAG documentation.

## Load and chat with documents {#chat-with-documents}

Use the [OpenRAG **Chat**](/chat) to explore the documents in your OpenRAG database using natural language queries.
Some documents are included by default to get you started, and you can load your own documents.

1. In OpenRAG, click <Icon name="MessageSquare" aria-hidden="true"/> **Chat**.

2. For this quickstart, ask the agent what documents are available.
For example: `What documents are available to you?`

   The agent responds with a summary of OpenRAG's default documents.

3. To verify the agent's response, click <Icon name="Library" aria-hidden="true"/> **Knowledge** to view the documents stored in the OpenRAG OpenSearch database.
You can click a document to view the chunks of the document as they are stored in the database.

4. Click **Add Knowledge** to add your own documents to your OpenRAG knowledge base.

   For this quickstart, use either the <Icon name="File" aria-hidden="true"/> **File** or <Icon name="Folder" aria-hidden="true"/> **Folder** upload options to load documents from your local machine.
   **Folder** uploads an entire directory.
   The default directory is `~/.openrag/documents`.

   For other ingestion options, see [Ingest knowledge](/ingestion).

5. Return to the **Chat** window, and then ask a question related to the documents that you just uploaded.

   If the agent's response doesn't seem to reference your documents correctly, see [Troubleshoot chat issues](/support/troubleshoot#chat-issues).

## Change the language model and chat settings {#change-components}

In OpenRAG, you can change some chat and ingestion settings directly on the **Settings** page.
For full customization capabilities, you can edit the underlying [Langflow flows](/agents) in the OpenRAG's embedded Langflow visual editor.

For this quickstart, try changing the **Language Model** or **Agent Instructions**.
Editing the flow in Langflow is optional.

<PartialEditAgentFlow />

5. Ask the same question you asked in [Load and chat with documents](#chat-with-documents) to see how the response differs from the original settings.

6. To undo your changes, go to **Settings**, and then click **Restore flow** to revert the flow to its original state when you first installed OpenRAG.

## Next steps

* **Reinstall OpenRAG with your preferred settings**: This quickstart used `uvx` and a minimal setup to demonstrate OpenRAG's core functionality.
It is recommended that you [reinstall OpenRAG](/reinstall) with your preferred configuration and [installation method](/install-options).

* **Use the OpenRAG SDKs**: To interact with OpenRAG programmatically, use the [OpenRAG SDKs](/reference/api-sdk-overview).

* **Learn more about OpenRAG**: Explore OpenRAG and the OpenRAG documentation to learn more about its features and functionality.

* **Learn more about Langflow**: For a deep dive on the Langflow API and visual editor, see the [Langflow documentation](https://docs.langflow.org/).
