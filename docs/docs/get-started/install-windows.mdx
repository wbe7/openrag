If you're using Windows, you must install OpenRAG within the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

For guided configuration and simplified container management, install OpenRAG with containers managed by the [Terminal User Interface (TUI)](/tui).
For self-managed containers, deploy OpenRAG with Docker or Podman inside your WSL distribution.
