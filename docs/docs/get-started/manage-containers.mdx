Container management is an essential part of maintaining your OpenRAG deployment.

## Manage containers with the TUI

If you [installed OpenRAG](/install-options) with the automated installer script, `uv`, or `uvx`, you can use the [Terminal User Interface (TUI)](/tui) to manage your containers:

* Start and stop OpenRAG containers.
* Start and stop OpenRAG's native services (Docling).
* View the status of your OpenRAG services.
* Access container logs for troubleshooting.
* Upgrade your OpenRAG containers to the latest version.
* Reset your OpenRAG containers to an initial state (destructive).

## Manage containers with Docker or Podman

If you [deployed OpenRAG with self-managed containers](/docker), run Docker or Podman commands to manage your OpenRAG containers.

* Start containers
* Stop containers
* View container status
* Access container logs for troubleshooting
* Upgrade your OpenRAG containers to the latest version
* Reset your OpenRAG containers to an initial state (destructive)
