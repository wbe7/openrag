Service management is an essential part of maintaining your OpenRAG deployment.

Most OpenRAG services run in containers.
However, some services, like Docling, run directly on the local machine.

If you [installed OpenRAG](/install-options) with the automated installer script, `uv`, or `uvx`, you can use the [Terminal User Interface (TUI)](/tui) to manage your OpenRAG configuration and services.

For [self-managed deployments](/docker), run Docker or Podman commands to manage your OpenRAG services.

## Monitor services and view logs

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="TUI" label="TUI-managed services" default>

In the TUI, click **Status** to access diagnostics and controls for all OpenRAG services, including container health, ports, and image versions.

To view streaming logs, click the name of a service, and then press <kbd>l</kbd>.

For the Docling native service, see [Stop, start, and inspect native services](#start-native-services).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="env" label="Self-managed services">

For self-managed container services, you can get container logs with [`docker compose logs`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/compose/logs/) or [`podman logs`](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-logs.1.html).

For the Docling native service, see [Stop, start, and inspect native services](#start-native-services).

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Stop and start containers

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="TUI" label="TUI-managed services" default>

On the TUI's **Status** page, you can stop, start, and restart OpenRAG's container-based services.

<details>
<summary>How does the TUI start the containers?</summary>

When you click **Restart** or **Start Services** in the TUI, the following processes are triggered:

1. OpenRAG automatically detects your container runtime, and then checks if your machine has compatible GPU support by checking for `CUDA`, `NVIDIA_SMI`, and Docker/Podman runtime support. This check determines which Docker Compose file OpenRAG uses because there are separate Docker Compose files for GPU and CPU deployments.

2. OpenRAG pulls the OpenRAG container images with `docker compose pull` if any images are missing.

3. OpenRAG deploys the containers with `docker compose up -d`.

</details>

Alternatively, you can manually run the Docker/Podman commands to stop and start containers.
Typically, this is only necessary if there is an error preventing the TUI from managing the containers.

* Stop all containers: [`docker compose down`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/compose/down/) or `podman compose down`
* Start all containers: [`docker compose up -d`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/compose/up/) or `podman compose up -d`
* Stop one container: `docker stop CONTAINER_ID` or `podman stop CONTAINER_ID`
* Start one container: `docker start CONTAINER_ID` or `podman start CONTAINER_ID`

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="env" label="Self-managed services">

For self-managed deployments, run the Docker/Podman commands to stop and start containers:

* Stop all containers: [`docker compose down`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/compose/down/) or `podman compose down`
* Start all containers: [`docker compose up -d`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/compose/up/) or `podman compose up -d`
* Stop one container: `docker stop CONTAINER_ID` or `podman stop CONTAINER_ID`
* Start one container: `docker start CONTAINER_ID` or `podman start CONTAINER_ID`

## Stop, start, and inspect native services (Docling) {#start-native-services}

A _native service_ in OpenRAG is a service that runs locally on your machine, not within a container. For example, the `docling serve` process is an OpenRAG native service because this document processing service runs on your local machine, separate from the OpenRAG containers.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="TUI" label="TUI-managed services" default>

On the TUI's **Status** page, you can stop, start, restart, and inspect OpenRAG's native services.

The **Native Services** section lists the status, port, and process ID (PID) for each native service.

To manage a native service, click the service's name, and then click **Stop**, **Start** or **Restart**.

To view the logs for a native service, click the service's name, and then press <kbd>l</kbd>.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="env" label="Self-managed services">

Because the Docling service doesn't run in a container, you must start and stop it manually on the host machine:

* Stop `docling serve`:

   ```bash
   uv run python scripts/docling_ctl.py stop
   ```

* Start `docling serve`:

   ```bash
   uv run python scripts/docling_ctl.py start --port 5001
   ```

* Check that `docling serve` is running:

   ```bash
   uv run python scripts/docling_ctl.py status
   ```

   If `docling serve` is running, the output includes the status, address, and process ID (PID):

   ```text
   Status: running
   Endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:5001
   Docs: http://127.0.0.1:5001/docs
   PID: 27746
   ```

## Upgrade services

See [Upgrade OpenRAG](/upgrade).

## Reset containers (destructive) {#reset-containers}

<PartialFactorResetWarning />

Use these steps to reset your OpenRAG deployment by recreating the containers and deleting all data in the `~/.openrag` directory _except_ for the `.env` file and the `/documents` subdirectory.

This restores your OpenRAG deployment to a near-initial state while preserving your configuration (in `.env`) and uploaded documents (in `/documents`).
Your documents are reingested into a fresh OpenSearch index after the reset.

To reset your OpenRAG deployment _and_ delete all OpenRAG data, see [Reinstall OpenRAG](/reinstall).

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="TUI" label="TUI-managed services" default>

<PartialExportFlows />

2. To destroy and recreate your OpenRAG containers, click **Status** in the TUI, and then click **Factory Reset**.

3. Repeat the [setup process](/install#setup) to restart the services and launch the OpenRAG app. Your OpenRAG passwords, OAuth credentials (if previously set), and onboarding configuration are restored from the `.env` file.

4. If you exported customized flows, [import your flows](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-flows-import) into Langflow after completing the onboarding process.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="env" label="Self-managed services">

<PartialExportFlows />

2. Recreate the containers:

   ```bash title="Docker"
   docker compose up --build --force-recreate --remove-orphans
   ```

   ```bash title="Podman"
   podman compose up --build --force-recreate --remove-orphans
   ```

3. Launch the OpenRAG app, and then repeat the [application onboarding process](/docker#application-onboarding).

4. If you exported customized flows, [import your flows](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-flows-import) into Langflow after completing the onboarding process.

## Prune images

Use image pruning to free up disk space by removing unused OpenRAG container images.

For TUI-managed services, use the TUI's **Prune Images** option to clean up your OpenRAG container images.
You can choose to prune unused images only or all images.
If you prune all images, the OpenRAG services are stopped, all images are pruned, and then the required images are pulled the next time you start the OpenRAG services.

For self-managed services, use [`docker image prune`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/image_prune/) or [`podman image prune`](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-image-prune.1.html) to remove unused images.
