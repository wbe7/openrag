You can reset your OpenRAG deployment to its initial state by recreating the containers and deleting accessory data like the `.env` file and ingested documents.

## Reinstall TUI-managed containers

1. In the TUI, [reset your containers](/manage-containers#reset-containers) to destroy the following:

   * All existing OpenRAG containers, volumes, and local images
   * Any additional Docker objects
   * The contents of OpenRAG's `config` and `./opensearch-data` directories
   * The `conversations.json` file

2. Optional: Remove data that wasn't deleted by the **Factory Reset** operation.
For a completely fresh installation, delete all of this data.

    * **OpenRAG's `.env` file**: Contains your OpenRAG configuration, including OpenRAG passwords, API keys, OAuth settings, and other [environment variables](/reference/configuration). If you delete this file, you must either repeat the [setup process](#setup) to create a new `.env` file, or add a populated `.env` file to your OpenRAG installation directory before restarting OpenRAG.
    * **The contents of the `./openrag-documents` directory**: Contains documents that you uploaded to OpenRAG. Delete these files to prevent documents from being reingested to your knowledge base after restarting OpenRAG. However, you might want to preserve OpenRAG's [default documents](https://github.com/langflow-ai/openrag/tree/main/openrag-documents).

3. In the TUI **Setup** menu, repeat the [setup process](#setup) to configure OpenRAG, restart the services, and launch the OpenRAG app, and repeat [application onboarding](#application-onboarding).
If OpenRAG detects a `.env` file, it automatically populates any OpenRAG passwords, OAuth credentials, and onboarding configuration set in that file.

## Reinstall self-managed containers

If you manage your own OpenRAG containers with Docker or Podman, follow these steps to reinstall OpenRAG:
