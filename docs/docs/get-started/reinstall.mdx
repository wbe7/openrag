You can reset your OpenRAG deployment to its initial state by recreating the containers and deleting accessory data, such as the `.env` file and ingested documents.

:::warning
These are destructive operations that reset your OpenRAG deployment to an initial state.
Destroyed containers and deleted data are lost and cannot be recovered after running these operations.

## Reinstall TUI-managed containers

<PartialExportFlows />

2. In the TUI's **Status** menu (<kbd>3</kbd>), click **Factory Reset** to [reset your OpenRAG containers](/manage-services#reset-containers).

   <PartialFactorResetWarning />

2. Exit the TUI with <kbd>q</kbd>.

3. Optional: Delete or edit [OpenRAG's `.env` file](/reference/configuration), which is stored at `~/.openrag/tui`.

   This file contains your OpenRAG configuration, including OpenRAG passwords, API keys, OAuth settings, and other environment variables. If you delete this file, the TUI automatically generates a new one after you repeat the setup and onboarding process. If you preserve this file, the TUI can read values from the existing `.env` file during setup and onboarding.

4. Optional: Remove any files from the `~/.openrag/documents` subdirectory that you don't want to reingest after redeploying the containers.
It is recommended that you preserve OpenRAG's [default documents](https://github.com/langflow-ai/openrag/tree/main/openrag-documents).

5. Restart the TUI with `uv run openrag` or `uvx openrag`.

6. Repeat the [setup process](/install#setup) to configure OpenRAG and restart all services.
Then, launch the OpenRAG app and repeat the [application onboarding process](/install#application-onboarding).

## Reinstall self-managed containers with `docker compose` or `podman compose`

Use these steps to reinstall OpenRAG containers with streamlined `docker compose` or `podman compose` commands:

<PartialExportFlows />

2. Destroy the containers, volumes, and local images, and then remove (prune) any additional container objects.

   <PartialFactorResetWarning />

   <PartialDockerComposeDownAndPrune />

3. Optional: Edit OpenRAG's `.env` file if needed.

4. Optional: Remove any files from the `~/.openrag/documents` subdirectory that you don't want to reingest after redeploying the containers.
It is recommended that you preserve OpenRAG's [default documents](https://github.com/langflow-ai/openrag/tree/main/openrag-documents).

5. Redeploy OpenRAG:

   <PartialDockerComposeUp />

6. Launch the OpenRAG app, and then repeat the [application onboarding process](/docker#application-onboarding).

## Reinstall self-managed containers with discrete `docker` or `podman` commands

Use these commands to remove and clean up OpenRAG containers with discrete `docker` or `podman` commands.

If you want to reinstall one container, specify the container name in the commands instead of running the commands on all containers.

<PartialExportFlows />

2. Stop all running containers:

   <PartialDockerStopAll />

<PartialDockerRemoveAndCleanupSteps />

8. Optional: Edit OpenRAG's `.env` file if needed.

9. Optional: If you removed all containers or specifically the OpenSearch container, then you can remove any files from the `~/.openrag/documents` subdirectory that you don't want to reingest after redeploying the containers.
It is recommended that you preserve OpenRAG's [default documents](https://github.com/langflow-ai/openrag/tree/main/openrag-documents).

10. If you removed all OpenRAG containers, [redeploy OpenRAG](/docker).
If you removed only one container, redeploy that container with the appropriate `docker run` or `podman run` command.
