:::warning
This is a destructive action that does the following:

* Destroys all OpenRAG containers, volumes, and local images with `docker compose down --volumes --remove-orphans --rmi local`.
* Prunes any additional container objects with `docker system prune -f`.
* Deletes the contents of OpenRAG's `config` and `./opensearch-data` directories.
* Deletes the `conversations.json` file.

<p/>Destroyed containers and deleted data are lost and cannot be recovered after running this operation.

This operation _doesn't_ remove the `.env` file or the contents of the `./openrag-documents` directory.

<!--
Author's note: Don't remove the <p/> tag!
For some reason, this specific usage consistently enforces the line break and indentation whether the partial is nested or not.

Without the <p/> tag, when this partial is used inside a list (ex. nested under a step in a numbered list), there is no implicit line break after the last bullet.
When this partial is used outside of a list (as a top-level paragraph), there is an implicit line break after the last bullet.

Neither <br/> nor wrapping the entire line in <p> </p> worked consistently for both use cases.
Either the line break was missing or the indentation was incorrect.

This behavior was observed in Docusaurus 3.9.2 on 05 Dec 2025. In a future release, if this is not longer an issue, you can remove the tag and this note. :)
