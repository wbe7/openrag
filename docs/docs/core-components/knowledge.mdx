OpenRAG includes a built-in [OpenSearch](https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/) instance that serves as the underlying datastore for your _knowledge_ (documents).
This specialized database is used to store and retrieve your documents and the associated vector data (embeddings).

The documents in your OpenSearch knowledge base provide specialized context in addition to the general knowledge available to the language model that you select when you [install OpenRAG](/install-options) or [edit a flow](/agents).

You can [upload documents](/ingestion) from a variety of sources to populate your knowledge base with unique content, such as your own company documents, research papers, or websites.
Documents are processed through OpenRAG's knowledge ingestion flows with Docling.

Then, the [OpenRAG **Chat**](/chat) can run [similarity searches](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/vector-search) against your OpenSearch knowledge base to retrieve relevant information and generate context-aware responses.

You can configure how documents are ingested and how the **Chat** interacts with your knowledge base.

## OpenSearch index {#index}

An [OpenSearch index](https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/getting-started/intro/#index) is a collection of documents in an OpenSearch database.

By default, all documents you upload to your OpenRAG knowledge base are stored in an index named `documents`.

<!-- TBD - better way to rename -->

It is possible to change the index name by [editing the ingestion flow](/agents#inspect-and-modify-flows).
However, this can impact dependent processes, such as the [filters](/knowledge-filters) and [**Chat**](/chat), that reference the `documents` index by default.
Make sure you edit other flows as needed to ensure all processes use the same index name.

If you encounter errors or unexpected behavior after changing the index name, you can [revert the flows to their original configuration](/agents#revert-a-built-in-flow-to-its-original-configuration), or [delete knowledge](/knowledge-browse#delete-knowledge) to clear the existing documents from your knowledge base.

## OpenSearch service port

You can access your OpenRAG OpenSearch dashboard directly at `https://localhost:9200`.

To change the port used by the OpenSearch service, edit the `OPENSEARCH_PORT` [environment variable](/reference/configuration#opensearch-settings).
