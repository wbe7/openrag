After you [upload documents to your knowledge base](/ingestion), you can use the OpenRAG <Icon name="MessageSquare" aria-hidden="true"/> **Chat** feature to interact with your knowledge through natural language queries.

The OpenRAG <Icon name="MessageSquare" aria-hidden="true"/> **Chat** uses an LLM-powered agent to understand your queries, retrieve relevant information from your knowledge base, and generate context-aware responses.
The agent can also fetch information from URLs and new documents that you provide during the chat session.
To limit the knowledge available to the agent, use [filters](/knowledge-filters).

The agent can call specialized Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools to extend its capabilities.
To add or change the available tools, you must edit the [**OpenRAG OpenSearch Agent** flow](#flow).

## OpenRAG OpenSearch Agent flow {#flow}

When you use the OpenRAG <Icon name="MessageSquare" aria-hidden="true"/> **Chat**, the **OpenRAG OpenSearch Agent** flow runs in the background to retrieve relevant information from your knowledge base and generate a response.

If you [inspect the flow in Langflow](/agents#inspect-and-modify-flows), you'll see that it is comprised of eight components that work together to ingest chat messages, retrieve relevant information from your knowledge base, and then generate responses.
When you inspect this flow, you can edit the components to customize the agent's behavior.

![OpenRAG Open Search Agent Flow](/img/opensearch-agent-flow.png)

* [**Chat Input** component](https://docs.langflow.org/chat-input-and-output#chat-input): This component starts the flow when it receives a chat message. It is connected to the **Agent** component's **Input** port.
When you use the OpenRAG <Icon name="MessageSquare" aria-hidden="true"/> **Chat**, your chat messages are passed to the **Chat Input** component, which then sends them to the **Agent** component for processing.

* [**Agent** component](https://docs.langflow.org/components-agents): This component orchestrates the entire flow by processing chat messages, searching the knowledge base, and organizing the retrieved information into a cohesive response.
The agent's general behavior is defined by the prompt in the **Agent Instructions** field and the model connected to the **Language Model** port.
One or more specialized tools can be attached to the **Tools** port to extend the agent's capabilities. In this case, there are two tools: **MCP Tools** and **OpenSearch**.

   The **Agent** component is the star of this flow because it powers decision making, tool calling, and an LLM-driven conversational experience.

   <details>
   <summary>How do agents work?</summary>

   Agents extend Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating tools, which are functions that provide additional context and enable autonomous task execution. These integrations make agents more specialized and powerful than standalone LLMs.

   Whereas an LLM might generate acceptable, inert responses to general queries and tasks, an agent can leverage the integrated context and tools to provide more relevant responses and even take action. For example, you might create an agent that can access your company's documentation, repositories, and other resources to help your team with tasks that require knowledge of your specific products, customers, and code.

   Agents use LLMs as a reasoning engine to process input, determine which actions to take to address the query, and then generate a response. The response could be a typical text-based LLM response, or it could involve an action, like editing a file, running a script, or calling an external API.

   In an agentic context, tools are functions that the agent can run to perform tasks or access external resources. A function is wrapped as a Tool object with a common interface that the agent understands. Agents become aware of tools through tool registration, which is when the agent is provided a list of available tools typically at agent initialization. The Tool object's description tells the agent what the tool can do so that it can decide whether the tool is appropriate for a given request.

   </details>

* [**Language Model** component](https://docs.langflow.org/components-models): Connected to the **Agent** component's **Language Model** port, this component provides the base language model driver for the agent. The agent cannot function without a model because the model is used for general knowledge, reasoning, and generating responses.

   Different models can change the style and content of the agent's responses, and some models might be better suited for certain tasks than others. If the agent doesn't seem to be handling requests well, try changing the model to see how the responses change. For example, fast models might be good for simple queries, but they might not have the depth of reasoning for complex, multi-faceted queries.

* [**MCP Tools** component](https://docs.langflow.org/mcp-client): Connected to the **Agent** component's **Tools** port, this component can be used to [access any MCP server](https://docs.langflow.org/mcp-server) and the MCP tools provided by that server. In this case, your OpenRAG Langflow instance's [**Starter Project**](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-flows#projects) is the MCP server, and the [**OpenSearch URL Ingestion** flow](/ingestion#url-flow) is the MCP tool.
This flow fetches content from URLs, and then stores the content in your OpenRAG OpenSearch knowledge base. By serving this flow as an MCP tool, the agent can selectively call this tool if a URL is detected in the chat input.

* [**OpenSearch** component](https://docs.langflow.org/bundles-elastic#opensearch): Connected to the **Agent** component's **Tools** port, this component lets the agent search your [OpenRAG OpenSearch knowledge base](/knowledge). The agent might not use this database for every request; the agent uses this connection only if it decides that documents in your knowledge base are relevant to your query.

* [**Embedding Model** component](https://docs.langflow.org/components-embedding-models): Connected to the **OpenSearch** component's **Embedding** port, this component generates embeddings from chat input that are used in [similarity search](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/vector-search) to find content in your knowledge base that is relevant to the chat input. The agent uses this information to generate context-aware responses that are specialized for your data.

   It is critical that the embedding model used here matches the embedding model used when you [upload documents to your knowledge base](/ingestion). Mismatched models and dimensions can degrade the quality of similarity search results causing the agent to retrieve irrelevant documents from your knowledge base.

* [**Text Input** component](https://docs.langflow.org/text-input-and-output#text-input): Connected to the **OpenSearch** component's **Search Filters** port, this component is populated with a Langflow global variable named `OPENRAG-QUERY-FILTER`. If a global or chat-level [knowledge filter](/knowledge-filters) is set, then the variable contains the filter expression, which limits the documents that the agent can access in the knowledge base.
If no knowledge filter is set, then the `OPENRAG-QUERY-FILTER` variable is empty, and the agent can access all documents in the knowledge base.

* [**Chat Output** component](https://docs.langflow.org/chat-input-and-output#chat-output): Connected to the **Agent** component's **Output** port, this component returns the agent's generated response as a chat message.

## Nudges {#nudges}

When you use the OpenRAG <Icon name="MessageSquare" aria-hidden="true"/> **Chat**, the **OpenRAG OpenSearch Nudges** flow runs in the background to pull additional context from your knowledge base and chat history.

Nudges appear as prompts in the chat, and they are based on the contents of your OpenRAG OpenSearch knowledge base.
Click a nudge to accept it and start a chat based on the nudge.

Like OpenRAG's other built-in flows, you can [inspect the flow in Langflow](/agents#inspect-and-modify-flows), and you can customize it if you want to change the nudge behavior.
However, this flow is specifically designed to work with the OpenRAG chat and knowledge base.
Major changes to this flow might break the nudge functionality or produce irrelevant nudges.

The **Nudges** flow consists of **Embedding model**, **Language model**, **OpenSearch**, **Input/Output*, and other components that browse your knowledge base, identify key themes and possible insights, and then produce prompts based on the findings.

For example, if your knowledge base contains documents about cybersecurity, possible nudges might include `Explain zero trust architecture principles` or `How to identify a social engineering attack`.

## Upload documents to the chat

<PartialTempKnowledge />

## Inspect tool calls and knowledge

During the chat, you'll see information about the agent's process. For more detail, you can inspect individual tool calls. This is helpful for troubleshooting because it shows you how the agent used particular tools. For example, click <Icon name="Gear" aria-hidden="true"/> **Function Call: search_documents (tool_call)** to view the log of tool calls made by the agent to the **OpenSearch** component.

If documents in your knowledge base seem to be missing or interpreted incorrectly, see [Troubleshoot ingestion](/ingestion#troubleshoot-ingestion).

If tool calls and knowledge appear normal, but the agent's responses seem off-topic or incorrect, consider changing the agent's language model or prompt, as explained in [Inspect and modify flows](/agents#inspect-and-modify-flows).

## Integrate OpenRAG chat into an application

You can integrate OpenRAG flows into your applications using the [Langflow API](https://docs.langflow.org/api-reference-api-examples).
To simplify this integration, you can get pre-configured code snippets directly from the embedded Langflow visual editor.

The following example demonstrates how to generate and use code snippets for the **OpenRAG OpenSearch Agent** flow:

<PartialIntegrateChat />

## Troubleshoot chat {#troubleshoot-chat}

The following issues can occur when using the OpenRAG **Chat** feature:

* Documents seem to be missing or interpreted incorrectly: See [Troubleshoot ingestion](/ingestion#troubleshoot-ingestion).
* Service is suddenly unavailable when it was working previously: If there is no other obvious cause, such as the service or container VM being stopped or disconnected, there might be a problem with the flow configuration. Use the [**Restore flow** option](/agents#revert-a-built-in-flow-to-its-original-configuration) to revert the **OpenRAG OpenSearch Agent** flow to its original configuration.
If you made customizations to the flow, make sure to [export your flow](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-flows-import) before restoring the flow.
