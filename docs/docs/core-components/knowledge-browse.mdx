The **Knowledge** page lists the documents that have been [ingested](/ingestion) into your [OpenSearch knowledge base](/knowledge), specifically in an [OpenSearch index](/knowledge#index) named `documents`.

To explore the contents of your knowledge base, click <Icon name="Library" aria-hidden="true"/> **Knowledge** to get a list of all ingested documents.

## Inspect knowledge

For each document, the **Knowledge** page provides the following information:

* **Source**: Name of the ingested content, such as the file name.

* **Size**

* **Type**

* **Owner**: User that uploaded the document.

   <PartialAnonymousUserOwner />

* **Chunks**: Number of chunks created by splitting the document during ingestion.

   Click a document to view the individual chunks and technical details related to chunking.
   If the chunks seem incorrect or incomplete, see [Troubleshoot document ingestion or similarity search issues](/support/troubleshoot#document-ingestion-or-similarity-search-issues).

* **Avg score**: Average similarity score across all chunks of the document.

   If you [search the knowledge base](#search-knowledge), the **Avg score** column shows the similarity score for your search query or filter.

* **Embedding model** and **Dimensions**: The embedding model and dimensions used to embed the chunks.
The embedding model, dimensions, chunks, and other ingestion behaviors are determined by the [knowledge ingestion settings](/ingestion-configure) that you set before uploading a document.

* **Status**: Status of document ingestion.
If ingestion is complete and successful, then the status is **Active**.
For more information, see [Monitor ingestion](/ingestion#monitor-ingestion).

## Search knowledge {#search-knowledge}

You can use the search field on the **Knowledge** page to find documents using semantic search and knowledge filters:

To search all documents, enter a search string in the search field, and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

To apply a [knowledge filter](/knowledge-filters), select the filter from the **Knowledge Filters** list.
The filter settings pane opens, and the filter appears in the search field.
To remove the filter, close the filter settings pane or clear the filter from the search field.

You can use the filter alone or in combination with a search string.
If a knowledge filter has a **Search Query**, that query is applied in addition to any text string you enter in the search field.

Only one filter can be applied at a time.

## Default documents {#default-documents}

By default, OpenRAG includes some initial documents about OpenRAG.
These documents are ingested automatically during the [application onboarding process](/install-uvx#application-onboarding) if you use the [default local documents path](/ingestion-configure#set-the-local-documents-path).

You can use these documents to ask OpenRAG about itself, or to test the [**Chat**](/chat) feature before uploading your own documents.

If you [delete these documents](#delete-knowledge), then you won't be able to ask OpenRAG about itself and its own functionality unless you re-ingest those documents.
It is recommended that you keep these documents, and use [filters](/knowledge-filters) to separate them from your other knowledge.
An **OpenRAG Docs** filter is created automatically for these documents.

## Add knowledge

Add knowledge to your knowledge base by [ingesting documents](/ingestion).

## Delete knowledge {#delete-knowledge}

:::warning
This is a destructive operation that cannot be undone.
:::

To delete documents from your knowledge base, click <Icon name="Library" aria-hidden="true"/> **Knowledge**, use the checkboxes to select one or more documents, and then click **Delete**.
If you select the checkbox at the top of the list, all documents are selected and your entire knowledge base will be deleted.

To delete an individual document, you can also click <Icon name="Ellipsis" aria-hidden="true"/> **More** next to that document, and then select **Delete**.

To completely clear your entire knowledge base and OpenSearch index, [reset your OpenRAG containers](/manage-services#reset-containers) or [reinstall OpenRAG](/reinstall).
