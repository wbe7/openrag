OpenRAG includes a built-in [Langflow](https://docs.langflow.org/) instance for creating and managing functional application workflows called _flows_.
In a flow, the individual workflow steps are represented by [_components_](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-components) that are connected together to form a complete process.

OpenRAG includes several built-in flows:

* The [**OpenRAG OpenSearch Agent** flow](/chat#flow) powers the **Chat** feature in OpenRAG.
* The [**OpenSearch Ingestion** and **OpenSearch URL Ingestion** flows](/ingestion) process documents and web content for storage in your OpenSearch knowledge base.
* The [**OpenRAG OpenSearch Nudges** flow](/chat#nudges) provides optional contextual suggestions in the OpenRAG **Chat**.

You can customize these flows and create your own flows using OpenRAG's embedded Langflow visual editor.

## Inspect and modify flows {#inspect-and-modify-flows}

All OpenRAG flows are designed to be modular, performant, and provider-agnostic.

To modify a flow in OpenRAG, click <Icon name="Settings2" aria-hidden="true"/> **Settings**.
From here, you can quickly edit commonly used parameters, such as the **Language model** and **Agent Instructions**.
To further explore and edit the flow, click **Edit in Langflow** to launch the embedded [Langflow visual editor](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-overview) where you can fully [customize the flow](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-flows) to suit your use case.

For example, to view and edit the built-in **Chat** flow (the **OpenRAG OpenSearch Agent** flow), do the following:

1. In OpenRAG, click <Icon name="MessageSquare" aria-hidden="true"/> **Chat**.

2. Click <Icon name="Settings2" aria-hidden="true"/> **Settings**, and then click **Edit in Langflow** to launch the Langflow visual editor in a new browser window.

   If prompted to acknowledge that you are entering Langflow, click **Proceed**.

   If Langflow requests login information, enter the `LANGFLOW_SUPERUSER` and `LANGFLOW_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD` from your [OpenRAG `.env` file](/reference/configuration).

3. Modify the flow as desired, and then press <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>) to save your changes.

   You can close the Langflow browser window, or leave it open if you want to continue experimenting with the flow editor.

   :::tip
   If you modify the built-in **Chat** flow, make sure you click <Icon name="Plus" aria-hidden="true"/> in the **Conversations** tab to start a new conversation. This ensures that the chat doesn't persist any context from the previous conversation with the original flow settings.

### Revert a built-in flow to its original configuration {#revert-a-built-in-flow-to-its-original-configuration}

After you edit a built-in flow, you can click **Restore flow** on the **Settings** page to revert the flow to its original state when you first installed OpenRAG.
This is a destructive action that discards all customizations to the flow.

## Build custom flows and use other Langflow functionality

In addition to OpenRAG's built-in flows, all Langflow features are available through OpenRAG, including the ability to [create your own flows](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-flows) and popular extensibility features such as the following:

* [Create custom components](https://docs.langflow.org/components-custom-components).
* Integrate with many third-party services through [bundles](https://docs.langflow.org/components-bundle-components).
* Use [MCP clients](https://docs.langflow.org/mcp-client) and [MCP servers](https://docs.langflow.org/mcp-server), and serve flows as MCP tools for your agentic flows.

Explore the [Langflow documentation](https://docs.langflow.org/) to learn more about the Langflow platform, features, and visual editor.

## Modify a flow at runtime {#modify-a-flow-at-runtime}

You can use _tweaks_ to modify flow settings at runtime without permanently changing the flow's configuration.
Tweaks are one-time parameter modifications that are passed to specific Langflow components during flow execution.
For more information on tweaks, see the Langflow documentation on [Input schema (tweaks)](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-publish#input-schema).

## Set the Langflow version

By default, OpenRAG is pinned to the latest Langflow Docker image for stability.

If necessary, you can set a specific Langflow version with the `LANGFLOW_VERSION` [environment variable](/reference/configuration). However, there are risks to changing this setting:

* The [Langflow documentation](https://docs.langflow.org/) describes the functionality present in the latest release of the Langflow OSS Python package. If your `LANGFLOW_VERSION` is different, the Langflow documentation might not align with the features and default settings in your OpenRAG installation.

* Components might break, including components in OpenRAG's built-in flows.

* Default settings and behaviors might change causing unexpected results when OpenRAG expects a newer default.
