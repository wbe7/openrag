    """
    Context manager for temporary files that automatically cleans up.

    Unlike tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile with delete=True, this keeps the file
    on disk for the duration of the context, making it safe for async operations.

    Usage:
        with auto_cleanup_tempfile(suffix=".pdf") as tmp_path:
            # Write to the file
            with open(tmp_path, 'wb') as f:
                f.write(content)
            # Use tmp_path for processing
            result = await process_file(tmp_path)
        # File is automatically deleted here

    Args:
        suffix: Optional file suffix/extension (e.g., ".pdf")
        prefix: Optional file prefix
        dir: Optional directory for temp file

    Yields:
        str: Path to the temporary file
